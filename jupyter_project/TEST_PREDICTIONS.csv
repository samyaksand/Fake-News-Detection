2439,Why The Obamacare Doomsday Cult Can't Admit It's Wrong,"But when Congress debated and passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2009 and 2010, opponents were nearly unified in offering grim Keech-like predictions. With Obamacare now in full effect, and the economy on a decided upswing, the dour prognostications are starting to look like Keech's flying saucers. At least if you believe the data. A look at Festinger's theories, though, can explain why that won't matter, and why Americans can expect a continued drumbeat of doom, even as the prophecies fail.

“It certainly has not had the baleful effects the critics were predicting,” said Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who supports the law, but never thought it would have much economic impact. “On balance it may be a modest plus, to the extent that it has contributed to the slowdown of growth in health care costs.”

But that's not how Capitol Hill’s gloomsday cult sees it. Indeed, try getting any of them to admit the Affordable Care Act jobs slaughter has not happened, and they sound like the punchline to the old joke where a spouse gets caught in the act cheating: “Who are you going to believe -- me, or your lying eyes?”

""With politicians, you can’t be sure that what comes out of their mouths is really what’s in their head,"" said Elliot Aronson, one of Festinger’s former students who is regarded as the foremost expert on cognitive dissonance alive today. ""When it comes to politics, we have to really look closely.""

The way cognitive dissonance works is that when people are confronted with information that contradicts either their beliefs or actions, they feel discomfort. To feel better, they either have to modify their beliefs and actions, or find some way to discount the disconfirming information. And the more effort someone invests in a particular action or idea, the greater the lengths they will go in crafting justifications to ease their discomfort.

Aronson and co-author Carol Tavris looked closely at that phenomenon in their 2007 book, Mistakes Were Made (but not by me). Among the examples are prosecutors who insist that people cleared by DNA evidence are still guilty; scientists who insist results that agree with funders’ interests could not have been swayed, and people who like an idea from their political party, but dislike the same idea if told it came from the opposition party.

Indeed, committing to a specific ideology can make it much harder to see facts clearly, let alone acknowledge them. Aronson noted that it’s especially hard for people who spent the last five years opposing a specific policy. “These guys are so committed to the belief that Obama can’t do anything right, and that Obamacare is socialism, that it would be very, very difficult for them to examine the data objectively,"" he said. ""I think that’s what’s wrong with politics, that’s what’s wrong with ideology, that’s what’s wrong with politics that are ideologically driven.”

“One could create some line of argument that the economy would be much, much stronger without the ACA, but that really seems to be a stretch,” said Van de Water, the economist. “We have a very large economy. Even as important as the Affordable Care Act is, it’s working on a major sector of the economy, but only at the margins. Even in advance, one would have thought it wasn’t going to have a huge effect.”","Why The Obamacare Doomsday Cult Can't Admit It's Wrong But when Congress debated and passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2009 and 2010, opponents were nearly unified in offering grim Keech-like predictions.

Indeed, after coming in a distant third in New York, Cruz has no real path to overtake Donald Trump in the Republican race before the July convention. On the Democratic side, Sanders would have to win 73 percent of the remaining delegates and uncommitted superdelegates to catch Hillary Clinton.

Clinton could actually lose every remaining primary in the coming weeks and still clinch the nomination. Next up are primaries in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Delaware next week. Clinton moved quickly to cast herself as the all-but-certain nominee.

""The race for the Democratic nomination is in the home stretch, and victory is in sight,"" she told supporters at her victory party in Manhattan on Tuesday night. A campaign aide, on the sidelines, said Sanders has no mathematical chance of a comeback.

Trump declared at his own victory party across town, “We don’t have much of a race anymore.”

Yet Cruz and Sanders were recalibrating their approach and their rhetoric, seemingly preparing to press on.

Appearing to acknowledge he could no longer clinch the nomination pre-convention, Cruz said Wednesday: “We are definitely headed to Cleveland. And in Cleveland, the people are gonna prevail.”

His campaign is likely back to concentrating on the delegate-selection process in order to strengthen its position going into Cleveland.

If Cruz – and Ohio Gov. John Kasich – can hold Trump under the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the nomination before then, the Texas senator aims to have delegate allies in place from across the country who would peel off from Trump and support him after the first round of voting. Further, his campaign is courting “unbound” delegates in several states – most recently in Pennsylvania, which votes next week and does not bind most its delegates to the primary results – in hopes they would also flock to him in the event of a floor fight.

The maneuvers have only strengthened Trump’s resolve to go on a huge winning streak in the coming weeks, racking up delegates in hopes of reaching the 1,237 threshold and ruling out the possibility of a contested convention. According to The Washington Post, an internal Trump memo projects Trump would get more than 1,400 delegates on the first round of balloting to secure the nomination.

Right now, Trump has 845 delegates, Cruz has 559 and Kasich has 147.

Meanwhile, Sanders, presuming he cannot clinch the nomination himself before the Philadelphia convention, is pursuing a tricky strategy.

""We're going to go to the convention,” campaign manager Jeff Weaver said on MSNBC. But the Sanders campaign seems to be relying on the prospect of winning over superdelegates, the party insiders and officials free to support whomever they want.

Clinton holds an overwhelming lead among them and is well-positioned to reach the 2,383 total delegates needed by the end of primaries in June, counting both superdelegates and pledged. Sanders officials seem to be raising the bar, though, suggesting she would need 2,383 pledged delegates to truly clinch the nomination.

But Clinton aide Jennifer Palmieri said the former secretary of state will continue to hold the pledged-delegate lead as well. And after a campaign period marked by an increasingly bitter tone between the two campaigns, she accused Sanders of going down a  “destructive path” during the New York race.

Including superdelegates, the race stands at 1,930 for Clinton and 1,189 for Sanders.

Sanders, though, has given some mixed signals on the heels of his New York loss.

He took a day off from the campaign trail Wednesday to return to Vermont.

And senior adviser Tad Devine, calling next week a “big week,” said: ""We'll see how we do there and then we'll be able to sit back and assess where we are.""

But Sanders continued to claim in fundraising memos they could still win.

He told reporters after landing in Burlington, Vt., that he’d get recharged in Vermont, and thinks he can do well in the five primaries next week. He plans to return to the campaign trail in Pennsylvania on Thursday.

Few in the Democratic Party expect Sanders to exit the race formally before the final contests in June. He continues to attract tens of thousands to rallies -- addressing more than 28,000 in Brooklyn two days before the primary. And he continues to raise millions of dollars, giving him fodder for a persistent fight.

4128,"Surviving escaped prisoner likely fatigued and prone to mistakes, police say","Police searching for the second of two escaped prisoners who pulled off an elaborate breakout from a maximum-security New York prison three weeks ago say that the remaining escapee is fatigued and likely to make a mistake after law enforcement officers shot and killed his accomplice Friday.

Hundreds of law enforcement officers have converged on a wooded area 30 miles from the Clinton Correctional Facility with helicopters and search dogs, where David Sweat is believed to be hiding. Sweat and fellow escapee Richard Matt escaped from the maximum-security prison in Dannemora about three weeks ago.

Matt was shot Friday afternoon after an encounter with border patrol agents.

About 1,200 searchers focused intensely on 22 square miles Saturday encompassing thick forests and heavy brush around where Matt was killed.

Franklin County Sheriff Kevin Mulverhill told Fox News that police are very motivated after Friday's events, while Sweat is likely fatigued, increasing the chances he will slip up.

""He's been out of prison for three weeks. He's been on the run for three weeks,"" Mulverhill said. ""He's in this area, he's now lost his cellmate, his escapemate is gone, he's alone.""

""If he's in this perimeter, we're pushing him we're moving him around,"" Mulverhill said.  He's tired, he's going to make a mistake.""

Sweat also could have an even tougher time now without someone to take turns resting with and watch his back, said Clinton County Sheriff David Favro.

""Now it's a one-man show and it makes it more difficult for him,"" Favro said. ""And I'm sure fatigue is setting in for him as well, knowing the guy he was with has already been shot.""

Authorities said Matt was shot by a border patrol agent when he failed to comply with orders in the woods near a cabin where a shot had been fired earlier in the day at a camping trailer. A 20-gauge shotgun was found on Matt, though he didn’t fire it at officers, authorities said.

""They verbally challenged him, told him to put up his hands. And at that time, he was shot when he didn't comply,"" New York State Police Superintendent Joseph D'Amico said at a news conference late Friday.

The breakthrough came Friday shortly before 2 p.m., when a person towing a camper head a loud sound and thought a tire had blown out. Finding the tire intact, the driver drove another eight miles before discovering a bullet hole.

Authorities converged on the location where the sound was heard and discovered the smell of gunfire inside a cabin. D’Amico said there was also evidence someone had fled out the back door.

A noise -- perhaps a cough -- ultimately did Matt in. A border patrol team discovered Matt, who was shot after failing to heed a command to raise his hands.

""As we were doing the ground search in the area, there was movement detected by officers on the ground, what they believed to be coughs. So they knew that they were dealing with humans as opposed to wildlife,"" he said.

""We have a lot of people in the area. We have canines and we have a decent perimeter set up and we're searching for Sweat at this time,"" he said.

The pair escaped the prison together on June 6. Gov. Andrew Cuomo called them “dangerous, dangerous men.”

Police blocked off all roads as officers hunted for Sweat in an area around Titusville Mountain State Forest in Malone, spanning 22 square miles.

Mitch Johnson said one of his best friends checked on his hunting cabin in Malone Friday afternoon and called police after noticing the scent of grape flavored gin as soon as he stepped into his cabin and spotting the bottle that had gone untouched for years resting on a kitchen table.

Johnson said his friend, correction officer Bob Willett, told him he summoned police about an hour before Matt was fatally shot and then heard a flurry of gun blasts.

Matt and Sweat used power tools to saw through a steel cell wall and several steel steam pipes, bashed a hole through a 2-foot-thick brick wall, and squirmed through pipes to escape.

Sweat was serving a sentence of life without parole in the killing of a sheriff's deputy in Broome County in 2002. Matt was serving 25 years to life for the killing and dismembering of his former boss.

A civilian worker at the prison has been charged with helping the killers flee by giving them hacksaw blades, chisels and other tools.

Prosecutors said Joyce Mitchell, a prison tailoring shop instructor who got close to the men while working with them, had agreed to be their getaway driver but backed out because she felt guilty for participating. Mitchell pleaded not guilty June 15 to charges including felony promoting prison contraband.

Authorities said the men had filled their beds in their adjacent cells with clothes to make it appear they were sleeping when guards made overnight rounds. On a cut steam pipe, the prisoners left a taunting note containing a crude caricature of an Asian face and the words ""Have a nice day.""

Clinton County District Attorney Andrew Wylie said they apparently used tools stored by prison contractors, taking care to return them to their toolboxes after each night's work.

On June 24, authorities charged Clinton correction officer Gene Palmer with promoting prison contraband, tampering with physical evidence and official misconduct. Officials said he gave the two prisoners the frozen hamburger meat Joyce Mitchell had used to hide the tools she smuggled to Sweat and Matt. Palmer's attorney said he had no knowledge that the meat contained hacksaw blades, a bit and a screwdriver.

Dannemora, built in 1845, occupies just over 1 square mile within the northern reaches of the Adirondack Forest Preserve and is surrounded by forest and farmland. The stark white perimeter wall of the prison, topped with guard towers, borders a main street in the village's business district.

The escape was the first in history from Clinton Correctional's maximum-security portion. In July 2003, two convicted murderers used tools from a carpentry shop at Elmira Correctional Facility to dig a hole in the roof of their cell and a rope of bedsheets to go over the wall. They were captured within three days, and a subsequent state investigation cited lax inmate supervision, poor tool control and incomplete cell searches.

The Associated Press and Fox News' Rick Leventhal contributed to this report","Surviving escaped prisoner likely fatigued and prone to mistakes, police say Police searching for the second of two escaped prisoners who pulled off an elaborate breakout from a maximum-security New York prison three weeks ago say that the remaining escapee is fatigued and likely to make a mistake after law enforcement officers shot and killed his accomplice Friday.

Hundreds of law enforcement officers have converged on a wooded area 30 miles from the Clinton Correctional Facility with helicopters and search dogs, where David Sweat is believed to be hiding. Sweat and fellow escapee Richard Matt escaped from the maximum-security prison in Dannemora about three weeks ago.

Matt was shot Friday afternoon after an encounter with border patrol agents.

About 1,200 searchers focused intensely on 22 square miles Saturday encompassing thick forests and heavy brush around where Matt was killed.

Franklin County Sheriff Kevin Mulverhill told Fox News that police are very motivated after Friday's events, while Sweat is likely fatigued, increasing the chances he will slip up.

""He's been out of prison for three weeks. He's been on the run for three weeks,"" Mulverhill said. ""He's in this area, he's now lost his cellmate, his escapemate is gone, he's alone.""

""If he's in this perimeter, we're pushing him we're moving him around,"" Mulverhill said.  He's tired, he's going to make a mistake.""

Sweat also could have an even tougher time now without someone to take turns resting with and watch his back, said Clinton County Sheriff David Favro.

""Now it's a one-man show and it makes it more difficult for him,"" Favro said. ""And I'm sure fatigue is setting in for him as well, knowing the guy he was with has already been shot.""

Authorities said Matt was shot by a border patrol agent when he failed to comply with orders in the woods near a cabin where a shot had been fired earlier in the day at a camping trailer. A 20-gauge shotgun was found on Matt, though he didn’t fire it at officers, authorities said.

""They verbally challenged him, told him to put up his hands. And at that time, he was shot when he didn't comply,"" New York State Police Superintendent Joseph D'Amico said at a news conference late Friday.

The breakthrough came Friday shortly before 2 p.m., when a person towing a camper head a loud sound and thought a tire had blown out. Finding the tire intact, the driver drove another eight miles before discovering a bullet hole.

Authorities converged on the location where the sound was heard and discovered the smell of gunfire inside a cabin. D’Amico said there was also evidence someone had fled out the back door.

A noise -- perhaps a cough -- ultimately did Matt in. A border patrol team discovered Matt, who was shot after failing to heed a command to raise his hands.

""As we were doing the ground search in the area, there was movement detected by officers on the ground, what they believed to be coughs. So they knew that they were dealing with humans as opposed to wildlife,"" he said.

""We have a lot of people in the area. We have canines and we have a decent perimeter set up and we're searching for Sweat at this time,"" he said.

The pair escaped the prison together on June 6. Gov. Andrew Cuomo called them “dangerous, dangerous men.”

Police blocked off all roads as officers hunted for Sweat in an area around Titusville Mountain State Forest in Malone, spanning 22 square miles.

Mitch Johnson said one of his best friends checked on his hunting cabin in Malone Friday afternoon and called police after noticing the scent of grape flavored gin as soon as he stepped into his cabin and spotting the bottle that had gone untouched for years resting on a kitchen table.

Johnson said his friend, correction officer Bob Willett, told him he summoned police about an hour before Matt was fatally shot and then heard a flurry of gun blasts.

Matt and Sweat used power tools to saw through a steel cell wall and several steel steam pipes, bashed a hole through a 2-foot-thick brick wall, and squirmed through pipes to escape.

Sweat was serving a sentence of life without parole in the killing of a sheriff's deputy in Broome County in 2002. Matt was serving 25 years to life for the killing and dismembering of his former boss.

A civilian worker at the prison has been charged with helping the killers flee by giving them hacksaw blades, chisels and other tools.

Prosecutors said Joyce Mitchell, a prison tailoring shop instructor who got close to the men while working with them, had agreed to be their getaway driver but backed out because she felt guilty for participating. Mitchell pleaded not guilty June 15 to charges including felony promoting prison contraband.

Authorities said the men had filled their beds in their adjacent cells with clothes to make it appear they were sleeping when guards made overnight rounds. On a cut steam pipe, the prisoners left a taunting note containing a crude caricature of an Asian face and the words ""Have a nice day.""

Clinton County District Attorney Andrew Wylie said they apparently used tools stored by prison contractors, taking care to return them to their toolboxes after each night's work.

On June 24, authorities charged Clinton correction officer Gene Palmer with promoting prison contraband, tampering with physical evidence and official misconduct. Officials said he gave the two prisoners the frozen hamburger meat Joyce Mitchell had used to hide the tools she smuggled to Sweat and Matt. Palmer's attorney said he had no knowledge that the meat contained hacksaw blades, a bit and a screwdriver.

662,Clinton and Sanders neck and neck in California primary,"No matter who wins California's 475 delegates on Tuesday, Clinton may have to woo the state's Sanders supporters as well as Trump fans before the Democratic convention – and possibly beyond.

With the California primary election looming Tuesday, it is still unclear which Democratic candidate will win one of the largest states' 475 delegates. To hear Hillary Clinton tell it, she's on the verge of beating Bernie Sanders in the Golden State and beyond, but the Vermont senator has told supporters that they're gaining ground, and stand a strong chance of cinching the primaries.

In the past few days, Mrs. Clinton has traveled the state in hopes of winning over the the delegates she needs in order to exceed 2,383 and get the nomination. ""I'm very proud of the campaign we're running here, and I believe, on Tuesday, I will have decisively won the popular vote and I will have decisively won the pledged delegate majority,"" she said on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

Senator Sanders' campaign, however, protests that delegate math and money don't tell the whole story. He's not ready to back down — especially with the strong coalition of supporters he has in California.

""It is extremely unlikely that Secretary Clinton will have the requisite number of pledged delegates to claim victory on Tuesday night,"" Sanders  told reporters in Los Angeles on Saturday, according to CNN. ""At the end of the nominating process, no candidate will have enough pledged delegates to call the campaign a victory. That will be dependent upon superdelegates. In other words, the Democratic National Convention will be a contested convention.""

Some Clinton fans, in particular, fear the continued intra-party fight will risk Democrats' unity ahead of the general election, leaving them vulnerable against presumed Republican nominee Donald Trump. Even if Clinton wins the nomination, part of her energy will need to go towards wooing ""Bernie or Bust"" supporters, instead of focusing on existing Trump voters alone.

Twenty-five percent of Sanders supporters said they would not vote for Clinton in the general election if she were the nominee against Trump, according to a Quinnipiac University poll. The ""Bernie or Bust"" movement may be even stronger in California, where the USC Dornsife/LA Times poll indicated that Clinton lagged behind Sanders 43 percent to 44 percent among registered voters. Only 65 percent of those who are voting Sanders in the California primary said they would definitely support Clinton in the case of a Clinton-Trump face off.

After Puerto Rico's primary on Sunday, Clinton holds 1,809 delegates and 548 superdelegates, for a total of 2,357. Winning the nomination calls for at least 2,382. During the Democratic primaries on Tuesday (when party voters head to the polls in California, New Jersey, the Dakotas, Montana, and New Mexico) 694 delegates, including 475 delegates in California, will be at stake.

Sanders also swept through California this past weekend, verbally attacking Trump, but also telling supporters the Democratic game wasn't over. If they turn out in force on Tuesday, he said, he'll be in a stronger position to capture superdelegates.

""If we can win, and win big here in California and in the other states, and in Washington D.C., we are going to go into the Democratic convention with enormous momentum,"" Sanders told listeners during a rally outside the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. ""With your help, I believe, we will come out with the nomination.""","Clinton and Sanders neck and neck in California primary No matter who wins California's 475 delegates on Tuesday, Clinton may have to woo the state's Sanders supporters as well as Trump fans before the Democratic convention – and possibly beyond.

Sanders also swept through California this past weekend, verbally attacking Trump, but also telling supporters the Democratic game wasn't over. If they turn out in force on Tuesday, he said, he'll be in a stronger position to capture superdelegates.

""If we can win, and win big here in California and in the other states, and in Washington D.C., we are going to go into the Democratic convention with enormous momentum,"" Sanders told listeners during a rally outside the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. ""With your help, I believe, we will come out with the nomination.""","clinton sander neck neck california primary matter win california's delegate tuesday clinton may woo state's sander supporter well trump fan democratic convention – and possibly beyond.

An investor in Dave’s fund emailed him asking which way Colorado would vote tomorrow. He replied: “Depends on who counts the votes. I don’t believe this is a fair election. I think the Clinton crime machine, with the help of George Soros and a few others, have everything under their control now.” 
After taking the better part of a year to sift through 55,000 emails in analyzing Hillary Clinton’s behavior with regard to conducting classified Government business on her private server – which apparently was accessible to hackers and, surreptitiously, by Anthony Wieners porn laptop – Jim Comey determined in 8 days that 650,000 emails downloaded from Hillary’s private server were not relevant. 
Sorry Jim, that’s impossible to believe. One highly plausible is that operatives in the Deep State shut down the FBI investigation in order to preserve the treasure trove of material that will give it power over Clinton’s Presidency. The SoT was perplexed by this, so we asked John Titus his take on this. His answer was quite compelling: Here’s what I’m reasonably sure of, based on experience. (1) Jim Comey looked sick when, at the conclusion of round one, and having proven beyond all doubt that Hillary violateed 18 U.S.C 793(f), he said no reasonable prosecutor would charge her. He wasn’t acting. Bad acting comes right through camera lens, and that man looked like he was about to vomit when he left that dais; (2) it took the FBI a year to conclude round one of its investigation, which was based on its review of 55,000 emails; (3) Comey had promised to get back to congress should more info arise, and when 650,000 unexpected emails showed up, he made good on his word by letting congress know; and (4) the FBI terminated its investigation LONG before reviewing 650,000 emails. I once reviewed 250,000 documents on a case, Based on the foregoing, SOMEONE got to Comey—somewhere along the line. For all I know, though, the whole thing was scripted from start to finish, and Comey read his script at every point along the way, even when it physically disgusted him in round one. So while you might be right about the time, I think if the Deep State made a move on Comey, it happened awhile ago. That’s wholly speculative on my part. You could well be right that they got to him just recently. I just doubt it. I think he’s the Company Man because he’s a company man. For DAMN SURE you’re right about holding Hillary hostage, but she’s so evil it’s like throwing a pedophile into a daycare center with no supervision, the shades drawn and the doors locked.

1220,"Why pundits, politicians and the press hate Ted Cruz","Senator Ted Cruz is now the frontrunner in the Republican race for the White House.

But if you believe the Mainstream Media and the political pundits -- Marco Rubio won the Iowa Caucus.

Click here to get Todd’s American Dispatch – a must-read for conservatives!

Just look at Tuesday's news coverage -- they marginalized Senator Cruz -- and glorified Senator Rubio.

And that's the narrative. Cruz may have won -- but Rubio is more electable. And yet... the numbers in Iowa tell a very different story.

One out of three evangelical voters chose Cruz -- so did four out of ten very conservative voters.

And 26 percent of young voters -- 18 to 29 - -- they didn't vote for Rubio -- they also voted for Cruz.

The voters recognize  a simple truth. Senator Cruz has been a man of his word -- a principled conservative -- and that is something the Establishment cannot tolerate.

“What we are seeing is evangelicals who have been dormant in the political process that are turning out,” said Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council. “It’s something we haven’t seen in a number of years.”

Perkins, who has endorsed Cruz, told me the voters are not interested in a moderate candidate. They don’t want someone in the “middle.”

“There’s nothing in the middle of the road but yellow stripes and dead animals,” Perkins said.

Looking back on the results in Iowa, Perkins said there should be one take-away for voters.

“Do not listen to the pundits or the polls – but vote your values,” he said. “It was values voters and the return of those voters that put Ted Cruz over the top.”

It's not that the pundits and politicos hate Senator Cruz - they know he can't be controlled -- and that has them terrified.

“Indications that Clinton is heading towards a solid win” might suggest that 2016 is “the safest year ever to vote Green, right?” No, say Democrats. 
“Dems will never admit it’s a good time to go Green,” writes Scott McLarty, media coordinator for the Green Party, at The Hill. “They want a field permanently limited to two parties of war and Wall Street.” 
To understand what we’ve lost under the two-party racket, compare the cringeworthy Clinton-Trump debates with Green nominee Jill Stein’s rebuttals. 
Stein addressed issues that were either touched on superficially or absent from the bipartisan bicker-fest. She proposed solutions — especially the Green New Deal. Progressive ideas, the kind advanced by Bernie Sanders in his call for political revolution, are effectively censored in the debates. 
Marginalization of alt-parties in the late 20th century is one of the unmentioned reasons for the triumph of the right wing in both major parties. It explains the disappearance of big progressive ideas like FDR’s New Deal and LBJ’s Great Society. 
The Green New Deal is a vision of how we can improve the lives of millions of people and rescue the planet from climate chaos. 
Today’s Democrats give us no such vision. All they’ve offered is modest reforms, ideas that pretended to be progressive but aren’t (e.g., Obamacare, originally Romneycare), and slogans like “Change We Can Believe In.” The vision Hillary Clinton evokes is “I’m not Trump.” 
The two-party racket is incapable of dealing with the crises of the 21st century: climate change; creeping corporate oligarchy and economic inequality; the national-security/mass-incarceration state; endless war. 
These crises promise an era of deteriorating quality of life, increasing personal debt, eroded rights and freedoms, lawless militarism, and social breakdown. The danger they pose can be compared with the rise of totalitarian states and the Cold War’s nuclear menace during the 20th century.","The ‘Two-Party Racket’ Is Incapable of Dealing With Our Present Crises The ‘Two-Party Racket’ Is Incapable of Dealing With Our Present Crises   Ian Sane / (CC-BY-2.0)

4099,"Just the Beginning? Religious Freedom, Gay Rights Battle Turns Ugly","Ten months after the Supreme Court passed a landmark case on gay marriage, a backlash against the ruling is spreading across the country.

Thirty-four states are considering new bills that would protect Christians from the threat of legal action because they object to gay marriage on religious grounds.

It's shaping up to be a fierce debate as gay activists and people of faith battle for their rights to be protected.

Business owners Dick and Betty Odgaards' story should serve as a warning of what happens when so-called religious freedom laws are not in place to protect people of faith.

On August 3, 2013, a gay couple asked the Odgaards if they could rent their gallery in Iowa for a same-sex wedding.

""They came in, and Dick was there, and he was the one who had to deliver the bad news to them,"" Betty recalled.

The Odgaards refused, citing their Christian belief that marriage should be between one man and one woman.

""I don't want to celebrate my sins. I don't want other people to celebrate my sins, nor do I want to participate in celebrating anybody else's sins,"" Richard said.

The gay couple sued them for discrimination and after a two-year court battle, rather than celebrate gay marriages, the Christian couple paid the couple a fine and agreed to stop hosting weddings at the gallery.

""It has been difficult. I won't lie,"" Betty acknowledged. ""It has been the hardest thing we've ever been through and I don't wish it upon anyone.""

Their decision cost them dearly. After months of negative publicity, hate mail, death threats and loss of income, the Gortz Haus Gallery went out of business last year.

""The ugly continues to come at us, but I wouldn't want to be anywhere else and we would do it all over again the same way because we are in the middle of God's will,"" Betty told CBN News.

Since last summer's Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage, more than 100 religious freedom bills have been proposed in 34 states to protect Christians and others from the threat of legal action because they object to gay marriage on religious grounds.

Take for example the new law just passed in Mississippi.

""The Mississippi law says if you believe marriage is the union of one man and one woman, that sex is reserved for marriage and that we are created male and female -- it doesn't say you have to believe those things -- but it says if you do believe those things, we are not going to penalize you if you act on those beliefs,"" explained Dr. Ryan Anderson, a senior fellow with the Washington, D.C-based Heritage Foundation.

In Louisiana and Ohio, lawmakers are also proposing measures that protect pastors who refuse to perform same-sex marriages.

Anderson said the accusation that these religious freedom laws are discriminatory against gays and lesbians just isn't true.

""I think the basic argument here is that we are trying to protect pluralism, we're trying to protect diversity, we're promoting tolerance,"" he said.

But some of the laws have been met with fierce opposition from businesses, activists and celebrities.

For instance, North Carolina's governor was forced to roll back portions of a controversial new state law after several companies criticized the law and others threatened to stop their businesses in the state.

""I think this just shows you that what's taking place is a form of cronyism, it's cultural cronyism,"" Anderson said. ""Big business is using their marketing freedom to deny little businesses and religious people their religious freedom.""

What is clear though is that the backlash from last year's Supreme Court decision has brought religious freedom concerns to the forefront this spring.

Many Americans believe that the battle over gay rights versus protecting people's religious convictions is just beginning.","Just the Beginning?

878,Ten inconsistencies in Donald Trump's big foreign policy address,"For a speech purporting to challenge Washington’s accepted wisdom, there was much that was familiar about Donald Trump’s first big foreign policy address, not least the customary certainty of its delivery.



A call to challenge radical Islam through “philosophical struggle” as well as military force might even have come from the lips of Barack Obama. Certainly no mainstream Republican would ever disagree with the somewhat motherhood-and-apple-pie exhortation for US presidents to view the world “through the clear lens of American interests”.

But how closely the speech stands up to detailed scrutiny is already the subject of fierce political debate. Madeleine Albright, the former secretary of state put up to respond on behalf of the Hillary Clinton campaign, claimed she had never seen so many “simplistic slogans, contradictions and misstatements” in one speech. Trump’s supporters argue instead that he was at his strongest, skewering the inconsistencies of the Democratic establishment’s approach under Obama and Clinton.

Here are 10 passages that suggest Trump may instead be doing what all politicians like doing best: having his cake and eating it.

Some groups “will never be anything but our enemies”, Trump said after attacking Obama for doing deals with Iran. Only he claimed shortly afterwards: “The world must know we do not go abroad in search of enemies, that we are always happy when old enemies become friends, and when old friends become allies.”



Trump also blasted Obama for letting down existing overseas partners, promising “America is going to be a reliable friend and ally again”. Yet he delivers warnings about paying for Nato membership that might sound more like blackmail to some. “The countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense – and, if not, the US must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves.”

He was also ambiguous about America’s role in promoting democracy in the world, claiming “we are getting out of the nation-building business” but then adding: “I will work with our allies to reinvigorate western values and institutions.” He also argued that promoting “western civilization and its accomplishments will do more to inspire positive reforms around the world”.

Then there is the standard section of any recent US presidential speech that calls on Middle East nations to do more to fight Islamic extremism. “This has to be a two-way street. They must also be good to us and remember us and all we are doing for them,” he said of allies in the region. These comments might have more clout coming from someone who had not recently offended much of the Muslim world by threatening to ban their citizens from entering the US.

Some criticisms of Obama’s “humiliations” at the hands of foreign governments do not stand up to much scrutiny either. Trump said that Obama was snubbed during recent state visits to Cuba and Saudi Arabia because he was not greeted at the airport by a senior leader. “Perhaps an incident without precedent in the long and prestigious history of Air Force One,” claims Trump. Strangely, the Queen’s decision to send the lord-lieutenant of Essex – hardly the most prestigious of British officials – to meet Obama at London’s Stansted airport last week was not mentioned, perhaps because it is a pretty standard way of doing things.

A similar non sequitur arises in criticism of Obama’s failed attempt to persuade the International Olympic Committee to award the 2016 Summer Games to Chicago. The president should not have flown all the way to the IOC meeting in Copenhagen if he did not already know they were going to award the games to the US, argued Trump. But what would have been the point of flying all that way to lobby for something that had already been secured?

Perhaps Trump is just trying to live up to his maxim of keeping the world guessing. “We have to be unpredictable and we have to be unpredictable starting now,” he argued at the start of the speech. Except, by the end, he argued for the virtues of a more transparent and principled approach: “The best way to achieve those goals is through a disciplined, deliberate and consistent foreign policy.”

Sometimes it is best not to apply too much mathematics. Trump claimed, for example, that “there are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism”, an assertion already open to dispute, but went on to add on top “for every case known to the public there are dozens and dozens more”. If “scores” means at least 40, then by this logic, Trump is claiming the existence of around 1,000 more people than anyone else has.

If the speech has one abiding slogan, it too could have done with some more fact-checking. Putting America first sounds at first just like an extension of Trump’s hallmark promise to make America great again. Yet it also harks back to the America First Committee of the 1940s, a group set up to prevent the US from joining the second world war, only to be disbanded three days after the attack on Pearl Harbor.

But perhaps this just points to the biggest contradiction of the speech: the tension between its isolationism and its interventionism. At once, Trump urges more of a pragmatic and realist approach to the exercise of US power, unconstrained by the niceties of political correctness, and yet blasts Obama for having “no vision, no purpose, no direction, no strategy”.

It is perhaps unfair, however, to dwell too closely on textual analysis of a speech clearly written by a number of people. “We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism” is a powerful line, but it does not sound very much like it was written by the same man who told a rally in Pennsylvania on Monday: “Do I look like a president? How handsome am I?”","Ten inconsistencies in Donald Trump's big foreign policy address For a speech purporting to challenge Washington’s accepted wisdom, there was much that was familiar about Donald Trump’s first big foreign policy address, not least the customary certainty of its delivery.



A call to challenge radical Islam through “philosophical struggle” as well as military force might even have come from the lips of Barack Obama. Certainly no mainstream Republican would ever disagree with the somewhat motherhood-and-apple-pie exhortation for US presidents to view the world “through the clear lens of American interests”.

But how closely the speech stands up to detailed scrutiny is already the subject of fierce political debate. Madeleine Albright, the former secretary of state put up to respond on behalf of the Hillary Clinton campaign, claimed she had never seen so many “simplistic slogans, contradictions and misstatements” in one speech. Trump’s supporters argue instead that he was at his strongest, skewering the inconsistencies of the Democratic establishment’s approach under Obama and Clinton.

Here are 10 passages that suggest Trump may instead be doing what all politicians like doing best: having his cake and eating it.

Some groups “will never be anything but our enemies”, Trump said after attacking Obama for doing deals with Iran. Only he claimed shortly afterwards: “The world must know we do not go abroad in search of enemies, that we are always happy when old enemies become friends, and when old friends become allies.”



Trump also blasted Obama for letting down existing overseas partners, promising “America is going to be a reliable friend and ally again”. Yet he delivers warnings about paying for Nato membership that might sound more like blackmail to some. “The countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense – and, if not, the US must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves.”

He was also ambiguous about America’s role in promoting democracy in the world, claiming “we are getting out of the nation-building business” but then adding: “I will work with our allies to reinvigorate western values and institutions.” He also argued that promoting “western civilization and its accomplishments will do more to inspire positive reforms around the world”.

Then there is the standard section of any recent US presidential speech that calls on Middle East nations to do more to fight Islamic extremism. “This has to be a two-way street. They must also be good to us and remember us and all we are doing for them,” he said of allies in the region. These comments might have more clout coming from someone who had not recently offended much of the Muslim world by threatening to ban their citizens from entering the US.

Accuracy in Media 
In one of her secret speeches, Hillary Clinton said, “My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders…” Before this comment was revealed, Adam Taylor of The Washington Post tried to assure everyone that the idea of a North American Union, like the meddlesome and bureaucratic European Union, was dead. Such talk, he said, emanated from “fringe websites” and “conspiracy theorists.” 
The Hillary speech was made to a Brazilian bank known as Itaú BBA, which describes itself as “Latin America’s largest Corporate & Investment Bank” and part of the Itaú Unibanco group, “one of the world’s largest financial conglomerates.” 
The problem for Taylor and other faux journalists is that there is a whole body of research on the topic of a “ North American Law Project ,” designed to integrate the legal systems of the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The project is run out of American University’s Center for North American Studies, where students can concentrate in North American Studies . As a matter of fact, such degrees are being offered by several different colleges and universities, including Canada’s McGill University . 
Passed in 1993, NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, began the process of harmonizing laws among the U.S., Canada and Mexico. But the Council on Foreign Relations admits that the U.S.-Mexico trade balance swung from a $1.7 billion U.S. surplus in 1993 to a $54 billion deficit by 2014. This has led to a loss of about 600,000 jobs. 
In addition to shipping jobs to Mexico, NAFTA constituted subversion of our constitutional system. President Clinton submitted NAFTA as an agreement, requiring only a majority of votes in both Houses of Congress for passage, and not a treaty, which would have required a two-thirds vote in favor in the Senate. NAFTA passed by votes of 234-200 in the House and 61-38 in the Senate. 
A money crash soon followed in 1995 as Mexico was hit by a peso crisis, and a U.S. bailout was arranged. Congress would not bail out Mexico, so Clinton arranged for loans and guarantees to Mexico totaling almost $40 billion through the International Monetary Fund and the “Exchange Stabilization Fund.” 
Meanwhile, pressure has been building for the creation of a “North American Community”—also known as a “North American Union”—with regular meetings involving the leaders of the three countries. On June 29, 2016, the Obama White House issued a fact sheet on this year’s “North American Leaders’ Summit.” It said, “The economies of the United States, Canada, and Mexico are deeply integrated. Canada and Mexico are our second and third largest trading partners. Our trade with them exceeds $1.2 trillion dollars annually.” 
The leaders of these countries agreed to establish a “North American Caucus” to “more effectively work in concert on regional and global issues by holding semi-annual coordination meetings among our foreign ministries.” One item on the agenda was for the leaders to reaffirm “North America’s strong support for [Colombian] President Santos’s efforts to finalize a peace accord with the FARC guerrillas.” That fell apart on October 2 when a “peace deal” with the communist terrorists was voted down by the people of Colombia. 
But notice how these leaders claim to speak for “North America.” 
Going global, they also declared, “North America is committed to joint and coordinated actions to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda.” 
This is U.N.-speak for global taxes and other forms of foreign aid from the U.S. to the rest of the world. 
We noted in a column last year that the American people, through their elected representatives, have had absolutely no input in developing the new global agenda that President Obama has tried to implement without the input or approval of Congress. 
Interestingly, one of those deeply involved in this global agenda, as we noted at the time, was John Podesta, the chairman of the 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign who previously served as counselor to Obama. Podesta’s emails are at the center of the WikiLeaks disclosures about the operations of the Clinton campaign, the Clinton Foundation and the Democratic Party. 
Podesta, founder of the George Soros-funded Center for American Progress and a member of the elitist Trilateral Commission , went to work for Obama as a senior policy consultant on climate change. A liberal Catholic, he has been a professor at Georgetown Law School. One of the leaked emails shows Podesta saying that he applauds the work of Pope Francis on climate change and that “all my Jesuit friends say the Pope is the real deal.” 
Podesta was picked by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to be a member of the “high-level panel” of “eminent persons” planning the future of the globe. This so-called “High Level Panel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda” released an 81-page report titled, “A New Global Partnership: Eradicate Poverty and Transform Economies through Sustainable Development.” 
“In simplest terms,” explains Patrick Wood, author of Technocracy Rising: The Trojan Horse of Global Transformation , “Sustainable Development is a replacement economic system for capitalism and free enterprise. It is a system based on resource allocation and usage rather than on supply and demand and free economic market forces.” 
In this context, Wood argues that the major significance of the transfer of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is not the immediate need by the U.N. or some countries to censor websites, but to generate revenue for global purposes. ICANN will do this, he argues, through management of the so-called Internet of Things (IoT), the links between the Internet and networks, electronic devices and embedded technology with IP addresses. “IoT are the connections between inanimate objects and the humans that depend upon them,” he notes. To accomplish this, ICANN has devised a new IP numbering system called IPV6, described as the “ vital expansion ” of the Internet. 
“In terms of ‘follow the money,’ IoT is expected to generate upwards of $3 trillion by 2025 and is growing at a rate of at least 30 percent per year,” Wood argues . “In other words, it is a huge market and money is flying everywhere. If the UN can figure out a way to tax this market, and they will, it will provide a windfall of income and perhaps enough to make it self-perpetuating.” 
He adds, “Congress never understood this when they passively let Obama fail to renew our contract with ICANN. However, Obama and his globalist handlers understood it perfectly well, which makes the deception and treachery of it even worse.” 
Under the cover of “sustainable development,” Wood predicts the Internet will be used to construct a massive database on human activities, in order to monitor and control nations’ and peoples’ access to resources. It will constitute ultimate socialist control and a form of “digital slavery,” from which he warns there may be no return. Cliff Kincaid

Accuracy in Media 
In one of her secret speeches, Hillary Clinton said, “My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders…” Before this comment was revealed, Adam Taylor of The Washington Post tried to assure everyone that the idea of a North American Union, like the meddlesome and bureaucratic European Union, was dead. Such talk, he said, emanated from “fringe websites” and “conspiracy theorists.” 
The Hillary speech was made to a Brazilian bank known as Itaú BBA, which describes itself as “Latin America’s largest Corporate & Investment Bank” and part of the Itaú Unibanco group, “one of the world’s largest financial conglomerates.” 
The problem for Taylor and other faux journalists is that there is a whole body of research on the topic of a “ North American Law Project ,” designed to integrate the legal systems of the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The project is run out of American University’s Center for North American Studies, where students can concentrate in North American Studies . As a matter of fact, such degrees are being offered by several different colleges and universities, including Canada’s McGill University . 
Passed in 1993, NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, began the process of harmonizing laws among the U.S., Canada and Mexico. But the Council on Foreign Relations admits that the U.S.-Mexico trade balance swung from a $1.7 billion U.S. surplus in 1993 to a $54 billion deficit by 2014. This has led to a loss of about 600,000 jobs. 
In addition to shipping jobs to Mexico, NAFTA constituted subversion of our constitutional system. President Clinton submitted NAFTA as an agreement, requiring only a majority of votes in both Houses of Congress for passage, and not a treaty, which would have required a two-thirds vote in favor in the Senate. NAFTA passed by votes of 234-200 in the House and 61-38 in the Senate. 
A money crash soon followed in 1995 as Mexico was hit by a peso crisis, and a U.S. bailout was arranged. Congress would not bail out Mexico, so Clinton arranged for loans and guarantees to Mexico totaling almost $40 billion through the International Monetary Fund and the “Exchange Stabilization Fund.” 
Meanwhile, pressure has been building for the creation of a “North American Community”—also known as a “North American Union”—with regular meetings involving the leaders of the three countries. On June 29, 2016, the Obama White House issued a fact sheet on this year’s “North American Leaders’ Summit.” It said, “The economies of the United States, Canada, and Mexico are deeply integrated. Canada and Mexico are our second and third largest trading partners. Our trade with them exceeds $1.2 trillion dollars annually.” 
The leaders of these countries agreed to establish a “North American Caucus” to “more effectively work in concert on regional and global issues by holding semi-annual coordination meetings among our foreign ministries.” One item on the agenda was for the leaders to reaffirm “North America’s strong support for [Colombian] President Santos’s efforts to finalize a peace accord with the FARC guerrillas.” That fell apart on October 2 when a “peace deal” with the communist terrorists was voted down by the people of Colombia. 
But notice how these leaders claim to speak for “North America.” 
Going global, they also declared, “North America is committed to joint and coordinated actions to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda.” 
This is U.N.-speak for global taxes and other forms of foreign aid from the U.S. to the rest of the world. 
We noted in a column last year that the American people, through their elected representatives, have had absolutely no input in developing the new global agenda that President Obama has tried to implement without the input or approval of Congress. 
Interestingly, one of those deeply involved in this global agenda, as we noted at the time, was John Podesta, the chairman of the 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign who previously served as counselor to Obama. Podesta’s emails are at the center of the WikiLeaks disclosures about the operations of the Clinton campaign, the Clinton Foundation and the Democratic Party. 
Podesta, founder of the George Soros-funded Center for American Progress and a member of the elitist Trilateral Commission , went to work for Obama as a senior policy consultant on climate change. A liberal Catholic, he has been a professor at Georgetown Law School. One of the leaked emails shows Podesta saying that he applauds the work of Pope Francis on climate change and that “all my Jesuit friends say the Pope is the real deal.” 
Podesta was picked by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to be a member of the “high-level panel” of “eminent persons” planning the future of the globe. This so-called “High Level Panel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda” released an 81-page report titled, “A New Global Partnership: Eradicate Poverty and Transform Economies through Sustainable Development.” 
“In simplest terms,” explains Patrick Wood, author of Technocracy Rising: The Trojan Horse of Global Transformation , “Sustainable Development is a replacement economic system for capitalism and free enterprise. It is a system based on resource allocation and usage rather than on supply and demand and free economic market forces.” 
In this context, Wood argues that the major significance of the transfer of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is not the immediate need by the U.N. or some countries to censor websites, but to generate revenue for global purposes. ICANN will do this, he argues, through management of the so-called Internet of Things (IoT), the links between the Internet and networks, electronic devices and embedded technology with IP addresses. “IoT are the connections between inanimate objects and the humans that depend upon them,” he notes. To accomplish this, ICANN has devised a new IP numbering system called IPV6, described as the “ vital expansion ” of the Internet. 
“In terms of ‘follow the money,’ IoT is expected to generate upwards of $3 trillion by 2025 and is growing at a rate of at least 30 percent per year,” Wood argues . “In other words, it is a huge market and money is flying everywhere. If the UN can figure out a way to tax this market, and they will, it will provide a windfall of income and perhaps enough to make it self-perpetuating.” 
He adds, “Congress never understood this when they passively let Obama fail to renew our contract with ICANN. However, Obama and his globalist handlers understood it perfectly well, which makes the deception and treachery of it even worse.”

92,"White Kids Get Medicated When They Misbehave, Black Kids Get Suspended — or Arrested","In recent years, as a national conversation about racial discrepancies in American policing has heated up, a depressing subplot has also emerged: a pattern of similar discrepancies in how discipline is meted out in schools. Black students made up just 18 percent of students in the public schools sampled by the New York Times in 2012, but “they accounted for 35 percent of those suspended once” and 39 percent of those expelled — examining federal data, the Times also noted that “nationwide, more than 70 percent of students involved in arrests or referrals to court are black or Hispanic.” Even black preschoolers were not exempt: They made up the same 18 percent of the student population, but constituted half of all suspensions.

As everyone from the Times to the ACLU has noted, the enactment of tough “zero-tolerance” policies in schools has led to the criminalization of what had previously been viewed as minor disciplinary issues. Zero-tolerance often mandates that students be suspended — even referred to law enforcement and arrested — for minor transgressions: Until a 2013 rule change, Los Angeles students routinely received automatic suspensions for refusing to take off their hats (this fell under a category of violation called “willful defiance”), while a Florida district, the sixth largest in the country, set a state record for student arrests in a jurisdiction in 2011, primarily on charges of possessing small amounts of marijuana and spraying graffiti. The ACLU has called this phenomenon the “school-to-prison pipeline.”

Now, a new paper in SAGE takes a closer look at how race and class affect school districts’ approaches to punishment, but also examines another important element of school discipline: Some disruptive kids, rather than being punished, are “medicalized” — that is, eventually given diagnoses, therapy, and/or medication as a result of behavioral problems. As “problem behaviors such as inattention, hyperactivity, and defiance of adult authority have received increased attention” since the 1990s, the study notes, schools have increasingly sought treatment and made special provisions for disruptive students through mental-health provisions in state and federal legislation.

For the study, David M. Ramey, of Pennsylvania State University’s department of sociology and criminology, used data from over 60,000 schools in 6,000 districts to examine trends in how schools’ racial and socioeconomic makeup impacted how they dealt with misbehaving students.

Among other things, he found that:

If you’re a black student or you’re poor, you’re far more likely to be punished than offered behavioral treatment when you misbehave.

There was a strong correlation between the percentage of black students in a school and the rates of punitive discipline, and an inverse relationship between the percentage of black students and the rate of behavioral treatment. “Schools with more black students relative to other schools in the district had higher rates of suspension or expulsion and police referral or arrest” than other in-district schools, the study notes, and also had substantially lower rates of enrollment in mental-health and special education programs. Students in more socioeconomically disadvantaged districts are also far more likely to face criminalized punishment than kids in more affluent areas, in part, Ramey thinks, because criminalized punishment is cheaper than mental-health treatment, and these districts are often strapped for cash. Here, race and class are — as is so often the case — inextricably linked.

Ramey draws on prior work in the field to demonstrate that the far higher rates of criminalization black students experience may be the result of endemic bias on the part of school officials. An American Psychological Association study found that black boys are perceived as older and less innocent than their white peers, and some studies indicate teachers can suffer from the fundamental attribution error, attributing minority children’s misbehavior to different causes than they do white children’s. Ramey notes how one study found that schools blame “poor parenting, cultural deficiencies, and poor character” for bad behavior among racial minority children, and see that behavior as permanent and leading almost inexorably to involvement with the criminal justice system. Further, a study on enrollment in special education programs found that “teachers and administrators are less likely to attribute minority students’ misbehavior to underlying behavior disorders,” which could be ameliorated with mental-health treatment.

When school officials are given more leeway in how they discipline students, the role of race is more apparent in their decision-making.

“In disadvantaged districts,” says Ramey, “the school board tends to have a lot more power in setting disciplinary policy, in particular at the top, and it’s followed relatively uniformly across the schools.” A district might mandate metal detectors or zero-tolerance policies, for example, and every school follows those policies, regardless of the makeup of the student body. In more affluent districts, things are different. There, Ramey says, “The schools and administrators are allowed a greater degree of autonomy.” School boards outline a disciplinary guideline (usually tied to government funding through state or federal law) that they want to meet, but individual schools have more flexibility in how they meet them, be it through tougher punitive discipline or the expansion of mental-health programs. “This is where you see race really mattering,” Ramey says. “The predominantly black schools in advantaged districts have much higher levels of suspension than predominantly white schools in advantaged districts. Conversely, predominantly black schools have much lower rates of [mental-health-program] enrollment than predominantly white schools in advantaged districts.”

Some schools have come to mirror the adult criminal justice and mental-health systems in how they deal with problematic behavior.

For most of the United States’ industrialized existence, working-class schools tried to reproduce the organization and principles of the industrial labor force: vocational skills, and an emphasis on the values of order, compliance, efficiency, and uniformity. But various theories hold that as the U.S. manufacturing economy and its labor system fled overseas in the second half of the 20th century, the criminal justice and mental-health systems replaced it as a model for how schools should be run. Ramey says that some of the discrepancies in these systems are mirrored in U.S. schools: “There are racial inequalities in the mental-health system across the life course, and it’s the same with the criminal justice system.” Like their adult counterparts, children of color are far more likely than white children to be pulled into the criminal justice system. Like adults, they are far less likely to seek out or be referred to mental-health professionals for treatment. “A lot of these structural inequalities we see in adult systems of social control are reproduced throughout childhood,” says Ramey.

Of course, it’s not all cut-and-dried: The sources of racial disparities in treatment, for instance, do not lie exclusively within these larger systems. Black families have been shown to be “skeptical of medical and mental-health research, particularly contested and controversial issues like ADHD,” and are therefore less likely to seek out treatment, while predominantly Latino schools see less medicalized and criminalized discipline, all things being equal. “Some of the research,” Ramey says, “suggests that Hispanics and Hispanic families in Hispanic schools — in particular first-generation immigrants — tend to avoid social control institutions altogether, be it the criminal justice system, the mental-health system, or the medical system,” often due to language barriers, immigration status, and other concerns.

More research is definitely needed in this area, both because of limitations in this analysis (it does not look at the treatment of a black individual compared to a white one for the same behavior at the same school, for example) and the gravity of the issue. There is clearly a discrepancy in how schools respond to bad behavior based on the racial and socioeconomic makeup of their student bodies, but there are still plenty of unanswered questions about the details.","White Kids Get Medicated When They Misbehave, Black Kids Get Suspended — or Arrested In recent years, as a national conversation about racial discrepancies in American policing has heated up, a depressing subplot has also emerged: a pattern of similar discrepancies in how discipline is meted out in schools. Black students made up just 18 percent of students in the public schools sampled by the New York Times in 2012, but “they accounted for 35 percent of those suspended once” and 39 percent of those expelled — examining federal data, the Times also noted that “nationwide, more than 70 percent of students involved in arrests or referrals to court are black or Hispanic.” Even black preschoolers were not exempt: They made up the same 18 percent of the student population, but constituted half of all suspensions.

As everyone from the Times to the ACLU has noted, the enactment of tough “zero-tolerance” policies in schools has led to the criminalization of what had previously been viewed as minor disciplinary issues. Zero-tolerance often mandates that students be suspended — even referred to law enforcement and arrested — for minor transgressions: Until a 2013 rule change, Los Angeles students routinely received automatic suspensions for refusing to take off their hats (this fell under a category of violation called “willful defiance”), while a Florida district, the sixth largest in the country, set a state record for student arrests in a jurisdiction in 2011, primarily on charges of possessing small amounts of marijuana and spraying graffiti. The ACLU has called this phenomenon the “school-to-prison pipeline.”

Now, a new paper in SAGE takes a closer look at how race and class affect school districts’ approaches to punishment, but also examines another important element of school discipline: Some disruptive kids, rather than being punished, are “medicalized” — that is, eventually given diagnoses, therapy, and/or medication as a result of behavioral problems.

3517,Footage shows suspects in Brussels attack,"Brussels, Belgium (CNN) In grainy images from surveillance footage, a man wearing light-colored clothes and a hat pushes a baggage cart through the airport.

It's one key piece of evidence authorities are looking at as they search for suspects after two explosions at the Brussels airport and another at a busy subway station in the Belgian capital Tuesday killed at least 30 people and wounded 230 others.

ISIS claimed responsibility for the coordinated attacks, but authorities said it's too soon to say for sure whether the terror group was behind the blasts.

So far, police have released photos of three men they say are suspects tied to the airport attack, standing side-by-side.

Two of the men, wearing black in surveillance images, are believed to be suicide bombers who died in the explosions in the airport's departure lounge.

But investigators believe the one in light-colored clothing planted a bomb at the airport, then left. Authorities called him a wanted man and asked for the public's help tracking him down.

""The third man left a bomb in the airport, but it didn't explode. ... And we are now looking for this guy,"" Belgium's Interior Minister Jan Jambon said.

A photograph released by investigators shows the three suspects side-by-side.

Federal Prosecutor Frederic Van Leeuw said the two men wearing black in the photograph were likely the suicide attackers.

Video shows the men exiting a taxi and moving through the airport, according to two U.S. officials. The man dressed in white left the airport after accompanying the other two, they said -- a move the officials said appeared to be planned.

A break in the investigation may have come from a taxi driver who took the suspects to the airport.

The driver contacted authorities after seeing surveillance footage and gave them the address where he picked the men up, according to two U.S. officials briefed on the investigation.

That information prompted authorities to raid a residence after the attacks, the officials said.

Investigators found a nail bomb, chemical products and an ISIS flag during a house search in the northeast Brussels neighborhood of Schaerbeek, Belgium's federal prosecutor said in a statement.

Hours later, they were still combing through the building for evidence.

Security was high. At one point, a helicopter hovered overhead, carrying a sniper with a weapon trained on the building.

As masked, armed officers stood guard outside the building, the burst of camera flashes inside could be seen from the street below. Officers left the building carrying bags of evidence they loaded onto vehicles.

A Belgian government representative told CNN that 10 people were killed and 100 wounded at Brussels' international airport. At least 20 people died and 130 were wounded at the Maelbeek metro station, officials said.

The blasts sent wounded people fleeing into the streets, spurred evacuations of nuclear plants and transit hubs and led to raids in some areas as authorities searched for suspects and evidence.

Authorities in Belgium have been trying to crack down on terror threats for months as they raided homes in the area in search of suspects. Tuesday's violence came just days after investigators closed in on Europe's most wanted man, Paris attacks suspect Salah Abdeslam, who was hiding out in a Brussels suburb.

On Tuesday, Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel deflected a question about whether there is any link between the attacks and the Belgium-born French citizen's capture, saying it is too early to tell.

Michel said Tuesday he had ""no information"" about who was responsible for the attack, adding that authorities will find that out, but now their focus is on caring for the victims.

Two senior U.S. officials told CNN they believe the Belgium attack is tied to the same network as Abdeslam.

One of the two airport explosions happened outside security checkpoints for ticketed passengers and near the airline check-in counters, an airline official briefed on the situation said.

The subway station blast happened about an hour later in the Brussels district of Maelbeek, near the European Quarter, where European Union institutions are based.

""We were fearing terrorist attacks,"" Michel told reporters Tuesday. ""And that has now happened.""

But for survivors of Tuesday's blasts, the repeated warnings from officials in recent months didn't dull the shock of seeing the carnage.

""You cannot believe it; you cannot believe it,"" said Jef Versele, who was in the airport's departure hall when bombs exploded there. ""It was so insane. Not in my backyard.""

The second blast inside the airport blew out windows, created a lot of smoke and caused parts of the ceiling to fall, he added.

""People were on the floor,"" Versele said, estimating he saw 50 to 60 who were thrown to the ground and didn't seem to be able to walk.

Anthony Barrett saw the wounded carried out on stretchers and luggage carts as he watched from his hotel across from the terminal building.

""I could see people fleeing,"" he said.

After the attacks in Brussels, the home of NATO and the capital of the European Union, leaders inside Belgium and beyond vowed not to back down in their fight against terror.

In Belgium, where officials declared three days of national mourning, Michel offered a resolute message to those who supported and cheered the attackers.

""To those who have chosen to be barbarous enemies of freedom, democracy and fundamental values ... we remain united as one,"" Michel said. ""We are determined to defend our freedoms and to protect our liberties.""

In its message claiming responsibility, ISIS noted that Belgium is one of the nations ""participating in the international coalition against the Islamic State.""

A Twitter post widely circulated by prominent ISIS backers Tuesday featured the words, ""What will be coming is worse.""","Footage shows suspects in Brussels attack Brussels, Belgium (CNN) In grainy images from surveillance footage, a man wearing light-colored clothes and a hat pushes a baggage cart through the airport.

6109,Donald Trump’s Nightmare Comes True 10 Days Before Election – This Could Ruin EVERYTHING!,"0 comments 
With just 10 days to go before the most important election of our lifetime, Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans are soaring in the polls. The Friday announcement that the FBI would be re-opening its investigation into Hillary Clinton’s personal email server has not helped matters for Democrats, either. 
But none of this will matter if they are able to manipulate the vote. According to MRC Blog , that’s why the left is going to drastic measures to drum up Democratic voters, expanding voting rights to include non-citizens in major cities nationwide. 
The latest notable city to do so is San Francisco, whose Election Day ballot will include a measure allowing the parents or legal guardians of any student in the city’s public schools to vote in school board elections. Under this measure, people with green cards, visas, or no documentation at all would be allowed to vote. 
San Francisco Assemblyman David Chiu, who believes illegal aliens should be allowed to vote to bypass the “broken immigration system in this country,” made the following statement: 
“One out of three kids in the San Francisco unified school system has a parent who is an immigrant, who is disenfranchised and doesn’t have a voice. We’ve had legal immigrants who’ve had children go through the entire K-12 system without having a say.” 
Chiu is the son of Taiwanese immigrants. 
It is no secret that the vast majority of illegal aliens vote Democrat, because that is the party which is incessantly trying to buy their loyalty with an endless stream of handouts and promises of blanket amnesty. If it weren’t so, we wouldn’t see all of these liberals pushing so hard to give illegals voting rights; they simply do so because it works in their favor, not because it is actually good for anyone. 
Major cities from sea to shining sea are following San Francisco’s lead, which is just one more very important reason to vote for Donald Trump on Nov. 8. We need to turn this country around and FAST!","Donald Trump’s Nightmare Comes True 10 Days Before Election – This Could Ruin EVERYTHING! 0 comments

6456,Memo to Comey: Keep Your Damn Hands Off Our Elections,"  
Without a shred of evidence and against the expressed wishes of his superiors at the Department of Justice, the head of the nation’s most prestigious law enforcement agency announced the reopening of an investigation into the mishandling of classified material by Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton. The surprise announcement was delivered last Friday by FBI Director James Comey who knew that the action would create a cloud of suspicion around Clinton that could directly effect the outcome of the election. 
Recent surveys suggest that that indeed has been the case, and that Hillary is now neck in neck with GOP contender Donald Trump going into the home-stretch of the bitterly contested campaign. 
By inserting himself into the democratic process, Comey has ignored traditional protocols for postponing such announcements 60-days prior to an election, shrugged off the counsel of his bosses at the DOJ, and tilted the election in Trump’s favor. His action is as close to a coup d’état as anything we’ve seen in the U.S. since the Supreme Court stopped the counting of ballots in Florida in 2000 handing the election to George W. Bush. 
It is not the job of the FBI to inform Congress about ongoing investigations. Comey’s job is to gather information and evidence that is pertinent to the case and present it to the DOJ where the decision to convene a grand jury is ultimately made. Comey is a renegade, a lone wolf who arbitrarily decided to abandon normal bureaucratic procedures in order to torpedo Clinton’s prospects for election. The widespread belief that Comey is a “good man who made a bad decision” is nonsense. He is an extremely intelligent and competent attorney with a keen grasp of Beltway politics. He knew what he was doing and he did it anyway. It’s absurd to make excuses for him. 
In a carefully-crafted statement designed to deflect attention from his flagrant election tampering, Comey said this to his fellow agents: 
“We don’t ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations, but here I feel an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed,” Comey said. “I also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record.” ( CNN ) 
Let’s take a minute and parse this statement. First: “We don’t ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations.” 
True, because it is not the FBI’s job to do so. The FBI’s job is to dig up evidence and refer it to the Justice Department. Comey is not the Attorney General although he has arbitrarily assumed her duties and authority. 
Second: “I also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record.” 
“Supplement the record”? 
That’s a pretty suggestive statement, don’t you think? When someone says they’re going to supplement the record, you naturally assume that they’re going to add important details to what the public already knows. Obviously, those details are not going to be flattering to Hillary or there’d be no reason to reopen the case. So the public is left with the impression Comey is going to produce damning information that could lead to an indictment of Hillary sometime in the future. 
This is precisely why normal protocols require that no new investigations be announced 60 days before an election. Why? 
Because the public invariably assumes that “investigation” equals “guilt”. In other words, “The FBI wouldn’t be investigating Hillary unless they had some dirt on her. Therefore, I’d better not waste my vote on Hillary.” 
This is the logic upon which Comey’s dirty trick rests. He knows the effect his announcement will have because he is law enforcements version of Karl Rove, a bone fide partisan who’s mastered the dark art of political sabotage. 
And just in case Comey’s announcement didn’t produce the desired effect (by destroying Hillary’s chances for victory), a former assistant director at the FBI, Tom Fuentes, appeared on CNN shortly after the announcement was made with more explicit information. Here’s a clip from the interview: 
“The FBI has an intensive investigation ongoing into the Clinton Foundation,” Fuentes said Saturday, citing current and former senior FBI officials as sources… 
According to the CNN report, officials with the FBI and Justice Department met in Washington earlier this year to discuss opening an investigation into possible conflicts of interest between the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton State Department.” 
(“ Former FBI Official: FBI Has An ‘Intensive Investigation’ Ongoing Into Clinton Foundation “, Daily Caller) 
Okay. So we’re no longer dealing with just classified emails. The FBI expanded its investigation and is now wading through the real sewage, the pay-to-play corruption scandal that surrounds that vast reservoir of illicit contributions known as the Clinton Foundation. In other words, the FBI is on to something big, really BIG. I can almost see them dragging poor Hillary off to the hoosegow in leg irons and shackles. Isn’t that the impression the above quote is supposed to produce? Here’s more from Fuentes: ORDER IT NOW 
“Several FBI field offices and U.S. attorneys offices pushed for the investigation after receiving a tip from a bank about suspicious donations to the Clinton Foundation from a foreign donor, according to the report….” (Daily Caller) 
“Foreign donors”, “suspicious donations”, smoky rooms, bundles of money. It all fits, doesn’t it? It’s all designed to increase suspicion and make Hillary look like a crook which, coincidentally, is the relentless mantra of the Trump campaign. Funny how the FBI and Trump appear to be reading from the same script, isn’t it? It’s almost like it was planned that way. 
But what about the timing of all this? Is it really a coincidence or are Comey and Fuentes part of a one-two punch from the Trump campaign? 
And, more important, what does the FBI actually have on Hillary? According to Fuentes: 
“When the team looking at the Weiner computers went to the team of investigators who worked on the Clinton email case, and showed the emails to them earlier in the week, they said, “This is really significant. We need to take this to the Director.” ( 2:05 to 2:23 video ) 
Repeat: “This is significant”. 
What’s significant? Neither Comey nor Fuentes nor the more than year-long investigation has uncovered anything, unless you think the ridiculous rehash of the 15-year old Marc Rich investigation (which popped up on the FBI website this week) is “new news” that should alter the course of the election. This is pathetic. If they have something, show us. Otherwise, Ferme ta bouche. 
Check this out from Thursday’s Wall Street Journal: 
“As 2015 came to a close, the FBI and Justice Department had a general understanding that neither side would take major action on Clinton Foundation matters without meeting and discussing it first. … 
The public-integrity prosecutors weren’t impressed with the FBI presentation, people familiar with the discussion said. “The message was, ‘We’re done here,’ ” a person familiar with the matter said. 
Justice Department officials became increasingly frustrated that the agents seemed to be disregarding or disobeying their instructions. 
Following the February meeting, officials at Justice Department headquarters sent a message to all the offices involved to “stand down,’’ a person familiar with the matter said…. 
As prosecutors rebuffed their requests to proceed more overtly, those Justice Department officials became more annoyed that the investigators didn’t seem to understand or care about the instructions issued by their own bosses and prosecutors to act discreetly. 
In subsequent conversations with the Justice Department, Mr. Capers told officials in Washington that the FBI agents on the case “won’t let it go,” these people said.” ( Wall Street Journal ) 
Can you see what’s going on here? There’s a nest of rogue agents running wild at the FBI who’ve been giving the DOJ the finger while they conduct their witch hunt on Hillary. And what have they achieved? 
Nothing! So far, they have nothing. 
Now, I’m not a fan of Madame Clinton either, in fact I wouldn’t vote for her if they rubbed me down with bacon grease and stuck me in a bear cage, but, c’mon now, do we really want rogue cops and self righteous bureaucrats inserting themselves into our elections and picking the winners? 
That’s bullshit. 
If the FBI has some solid proof of wrongdoing that will put Hillary behind bars for good, than I say, “Bravo”. But until then, they should keep their damn hands off our elections!

in carefully-crafted statement design deflect attention flagrant election tamper comey say fellow agent 
“we don’t ordinarily tell congress ongoing investigation feel obligation give testify repeatedly recent month investigation completed,” comey say “i also think would mislead american people supplement record.” cnn 
let’s take minute parse statement first “we don’t ordinarily tell congress ongoing investigations.” 
true fbi’s job fbi’s job dig evidence refer justice department comey attorney general although arbitrarily assume duty authority 
second “i also think would mislead american people supplement record.” 
“supplement record” 
that’s pretty suggestive statement don’t think someone say they’re go supplement record naturally assume they’re go add important detail public already know obviously detail go flatter hillary there’d reason reopen case public leave impression comey go produce damn information could lead indictment hillary sometime future 
this precisely normal protocol require new investigation announce day election 
because public invariably assume “investigation” equal “guilt” word “the fbi wouldn’t investigate hillary unless dirt therefore i’d good waste vote hillary.”

7431,"Comment on Boy says farewell to best friend, 91-year-old World War II vet from next door by Joe","Grab a hanky… Photo courtesy of Anika Rychner 
From Today.com : Emmett Rychner was the first to move away. Two years ago, the young preschooler moved to a neighboring town, leaving behind his best friend, Erling Kindem, a World War II veteran who lived next door. 
Last week, the time arrived for a final goodbye. 
Erling, 91, died last Saturday, just three days after 6-year-old Emmett paid a visit to the nursing home where he was receiving hospice care. 
“After we told Emmett that Erling had passed away, he was very quiet for a while,” his mother Anika Rychner told TODAY. “The first thing he said was, ‘So we’ll just have to wait a really long time. I know we’ll see him again in heaven.’” 
For more than a decade, the two families lived next to each other in a Minneapolis suburb, but didn’t have much of a relationship beyond saying hello. That changed after Emmett came along. 
“He was about 2 when this all started. He would start venturing over to Erling’s backyard when he was out in his garden with his tomatoes,” Rychner recalled. 
One day, when Emmett saw Erling pouring dirt around his new sidewalk, he grabbed his toy shovel and wheelbarrow and walked over. 
Erling was tickled by his new companion and they instantly bonded. 
From then, Emmett went outside anytime he spotted his buddy. “He would also go knock on Erling’s door and ask if Erling could play,” his mother recalled with a laugh. 
The two had lawn mower races (Emmett rode his electric toy mower). They played croquet and rode bicycles. And they cared for Erling’s garden, which grew one of the boy’s favorite foods, tomatoes. 
“He especially liked the cherry ones that he could pick right there and eat in the garden. So he’d help Dad weed the garden,” Erling’s son, Charlie Kindem, told TODAY. 
Two years ago, Emmett’s growing family moved away to the countryside. A month later, Erling and his wife moved to a senior apartment. But the two friends continued to visit each other regularly. Photo courtesy Anika Rychner 
“Erling was still driving when we moved away, so we would sometimes come home and find tomatoes from his garden on our front porch, or a note for Emmett with some other treasure he brought him,” Rychner said. 
“If we hadn’t visited in a while, Erling would call, and we would go visit,” she said. “Or sometimes the kids we’d say, ‘We should go see Erling,’ and we would stop on our way home from school.” 
Emmett often drew pictures of B-24 bomber planes for his friend, who served as a radio operator and gunner during World War II. 
“A lot of kids are not comfortable around elderly people because they look different. Emmett always was,” Rychner said. “He was never was shy about hugging Erling and holding his hand.” 
When Erling’s wife, Joyce, with whom he had five children, died last fall, Emmett and his family attended her funeral. 
“It was a natural thing,” Kindem said of his father’s relationship with Emmett. “He didn’t talk down to him at all. He talked to him like he was a regular person and not a little kid.” 
But Erling was always like that, his son said. 
“Dad was always friendly with kids. Growing up, he would play with us, whether it was baseball or football,” he said. He recalled how Erling flooded the vacant lot next door to their home every winter to turn it into an ice rink. 
This past spring, Erling moved into an assisted living home. But his heart condition began to worsen and last month, he moved into a nursing home, where he received hospice care. 
Emmett saw his friend the day after he moved in, and again last week. That was when Emmett read his friend the Lord’s prayer, and Erling encouraged his buddy to listen to his parents. Their final goodbye… 
“It felt like a goodbye,” Rychner said. Erling passed away three days later. 
Emmett has been more quiet than usual, but appears to have absorbed the news, in part because his parents had been preparing him. Rychner said she considers it “a wonderful gift” that Emmett had the chance to experience the decline of a friend’s health in such a positive, natural way. 
She felt proud her son didn’t shy away from Erling, even in his illness. 
“We all have to experience death at some point in our life of a loved one. That’s an important part of growing up. You can’t avoid it,” she said. 
Both Rychner and Kindem said they have been moved by the outpouring of support since NBC-affiliate KARE first reported their story two years ago. The station continued to chronicle the friendship and reported the news of Erling’s death. 
“He has strong faith that he will see him again,” Rychner said.

9078,You Won’t Believe What This Congressman is Planning To Do If Trump Loses (VIDEO),"By: The Voice of Reason | We are less than two weeks away from the moment of truth, when the results of the 2016 Presidential election will more than likely be tallied, and we’ll have a new President-elect, at least in name anyway, if nothing else. I’ll preface this post by saying it’s not too late for people to still take as many precautions as possible in hopes of ensuring their families safety not if, but when all hell breaks lose upon the announcement of the election’s winner. The media has done their best to conceal it for whatever reason, but there have been ample warnings that there is the potential for massive amounts of violence regardless of who wins. The second video below runs through a laundry list of crimes committed by Hillary Clinton, which has a lot to do with why four in 10 Trump supporters say they won’t recognize the legitimacy of Clinton as president, if she prevails, because they say she wouldn’t have won fair and square. The second video cites specifics, and when you hear them, it’s no wonder why former Congressman Joe Walsh called for armed revolution Wednesday if Donald Trump is not elected president. Walsh, a former tea party congressman from Illinois who is now a conservative talk radio host, tweeted, “On November 8th, I’m voting for Trump . On November 9th, if Trump loses, I’m grabbing my musket. You in?” The former Congressman is hardly alone. A 51% majority of likely voters express at least some concern about the possibility of violence on Election Day; and one in five are likely voters are “VERY concerned,” and they should be. One 69-year old gentleman from Michigan said as the polls began shifting towards Hillary, he slowly began buying more ammunition. If Hillary Clinton and the Democrats win on November 8th, things will not go well for Hillary Clinton’s political enemies. Recall that over 70 of them are dead, five of which died in just six weeks under mysterious circumstances during the primaries that Hillary stole from Bernie Sanders. In the first video below, I review warnings issued by both sides of what will happen if the other party’s candidate wins. So far, if Hillary wins we have one former Congressman going for his gun, and if Trump wins, we have Black Lives Matter members saying saying back in March: “Dear white people if Trump wins young niggas such as myself are fully hell bent on inciting riots everywhere we go. Just so you know.” That’s just the tip of the iceberg… The question posed, “What would you do,” is primarily directed at Trump supporters if Hillary wins, because the only way she’s winning anything, is by fraudulently stealing it, and doing so with Obama’s help! How can we make that assertion without any doubt? Starting off light, we know not just from Project Veritas videos released this week , but also from Federal Election Commission (FEC) records, that an activist was caught on camera bragging about having helped start violent disruptions at Donald Trump campaign rallies, and brags that was paid by the Clinton campaign directly right before she stirred up trouble. The Project Veritas videos this week merely confirmed the initial account. We also know that despite Julian Assange saying he did not get information from the Russians, when Trump was beginning to pull away from Hillary in the polls, and Hillary needed a distraction, her and Barack Obama had no problem peddling a baseless accusation against Russia, eventually angering Putin to the point where Russia deployed nuclear missiles into Kaliningrad , along the border with Poland, and aimed them directly at our allies in Berlin. Nukes pointed at our allies? Who cares right? In her mind, “the ends justify the means.” so long as Hillary wins… Then of course, let’s not forget the email that was leaked by Wikileaks that proved that Hillary was not only aware of the transaction, but she allowed weapons to be sold to ISIS during a time of war , weapons that were presumably used against either U.S. troops or American allies at the very least. That act has a name: Treason, and it’s punishable by death. Still, the list goes on, including her use of psychological weapons against voters as detailed in one of her internal campaign documents leaked as part of the Podesta emails. In the second video, Alex Jones makes his point very clearly, that there is NO level the Democrats won’t stoop to for control of the White House. None. Zero. Furthermore, If by some chance all their fraud isn’t enough, and Hillary doesn’t win, they plan to burn American cities to the ground. Have you heard of any plans put in place by Obama to stop that? Of course not. Trump supporters: If Hillary is willing to do all those things, and so many more I don’t have the time to go into but have all been well documented, just so she can gain entry into Oval Office, what do you think she’ll act like once she takes possession of the Office of the President? We know what the Soros funded far-left has planned if Trump wins because they’ve told us countless times, what about the Trump supporters if Hillary wins? In the video below, Alex Jones asks the question, “Is there anything, anything at all that Hillary and the Democrats won’t do?” The answer to that seems clear. The question then is really whether people think that if Hillary is announced as the winner, is it likely that the American voters will put up with that criminal behavior and just roll over, or is it more likely we’re going to see some violence break out?

8054,Rutgers Student Fired from Campus Newspaper After Writing ‘Illegal Alien’ in Column,"Toni Airaksinen, College Fix, November 4, 2016 
{snip} 
The Rutgers University student who hosted anti-feminist provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos for his first U.S. college event says the student newspaper fired him Monday because of his conservative views. 
Aviv Khavich published his final column for The Daily Targum Sunday night, arguing that immigration enforcement is not “anti-immigrant.” 
He spoke as an immigrant himself, born in Israel after his Ashkenazi Jewish parents fled Belarus in the wake of the Soviet Union’s collapse. 
But the trigger for the firing may have been Khavich’s demand that his column include the phrase “illegal aliens” to describe those in the country illegally. 
It was the final straw for the Daily’s editor, who said Khavich repeatedly fought over “stylistic” editing changes to his columns over the past several months. 
{snip} 
But two of his last three [columns] were about immigration. Khavich opposes accepting Syrian refugees into America as a security threat, and his final column Sunday said flatly: “Justice is mass deportation. Justice is respecting my [legal immigrant] family and millions of others like us.” 
Khavich told The College Fix in a phone interview that “every instance of ‘illegal alien’ I wrote was changed to ‘undocumented immigrant’” by his editors. “But I considered it a part of my opinion to not use” the latter term, which he finds “politically correct and also inaccurate.” 
When Khavich complained to his editor about the edited draft, she said the “illegal” edit came from the top: Editor in Chief Dan Corey wanted the column to follow Associated Press Style. 
The AP Stylebook was revised three years ago to disapprove of using “illegal” to describe a person, as opposed to an action, after having affirmed “illegal immigrant” just a year earlier . 
But AP Style also frowns upon “undocumented”–the term used in Khavich’s published column–because the term is “not precise.” Khavich notes that federal law uses the term “alien.” 
His editor was “not happy” after being confronted, Khavich said, and he was fired the next day. 
{snip} 
“At the slightest questioning of their ‘unbiased editing,’ they jump at the excuse to rid themselves of someone who has been challenging their narrative,” he wrote in The Tab. 
“I was writing articles that very strongly challenged narratives,” he told The Fix. “I am sure that it was a termination was based on political bias.”","Rutgers Student Fired from Campus Newspaper After Writing ‘Illegal Alien’ in Column Toni Airaksinen, College Fix, November 4, 2016

5252,Why Sanders supporters cannot back Gary Johnson: His libertarianism is antithetical to the senator’s Democratic socialism,"At the Libertarian Town Hall on CNN earlier this month, the Libertarian Party’s presidential candidate Gary Johnson and his running mate Bill Weld made a pitch to both “Never-Hillary” and “Never-Trump” voters on the left and right of the political spectrum as the sane and principled third-party alternative for 2016. And whether you agree or disagree with what the two former governors had to say, it’s hard to deny their likability — especially in an election where the two major party candidates are as thoroughly unlikable as Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.

Johnson and Weld presumably have a better shot at appealing to Never-Trump conservatives than Never-Hillary liberals or leftists (whose political views align much more with the Green Party’s Jill Stein), but the former New Mexico governor did make a compelling pitch — superficially, at least — to disaffected Bernie Sanders supporters at the Town Hall. And while polls indicate that the majority of the democratic socialist’s supporters will vote for Clinton in November, there is a minority faction that will be voting their conscience — and Johnson is certainly in a position to woo some of these voters.

With this undoubtedly in the back of his mind, the libertarian candidate said that he and Bernie are similar “on about 75 percent of what’s out there,” from marriage equality and reproductive rights, to the legalization of marijuana and the end of futile military interventions overseas. From an “economic standpoint,” however, Johnson admitted disagreement:

“If Bernie supporters are really looking for income equality, I don’t think that is something that government can accomplish. Taking from Peter to rob Paul, that’s an equation that Peter really loves. But if Bernie supporters are looking for equal opportunity, I think that is something that can be accomplished. … In politics, you can definitely stand up for equal opportunity.”

It was a cogent response that included an acknowledgement that “crony capitalism is alive and well” — something that libertarians and leftists have long agreed on (and equally object to). But apart from this, Johnson’s economic worldview is diametrically opposed to Sanders’ egalitarian vision of social democracy — and this should be enough to stop the latter’s supporters from voting for the former.

In the economic realm, right-wing libertarians (as opposed to left libertarians or “libertarian socialists”) are essentially classical economic liberals who reject most of the social democratic reforms that were enacted throughout the capitalist world during the 20th century. Instead of a mixed economy, libertarians advocate laissez faire capitalism and profess that even minimal state intervention in the economy will lead to tyranny — or serfdom, as the famous libertarian philosopher F. A. Hayek put it in his influential book “The Road to Serfdom” (this didn’t pan out, of course — instead, it was the welfare state that likely prevented more radical assaults on capitalism in the West).

In his statement, Johnson said that he doesn’t believe that the government can reduce economic inequality — which has soared over the past forty years — and equated redistributive measures to theft. This alone reveals the candidates dogmatic worldview. The social democratic reforms of the 20th century clearly demonstrate that wealth and income inequality can be curbed within a capitalist economy (and should be if leaders want to achieve greater economic and political stability). While Johnson is less fanatical than some of his party colleagues (indeed, he is considered too moderate by many libertarians), he is still undoubtedly the most extreme candidate of 2016 on economic matters. He opposes corporate taxation, supports privatized healthcare, advocates eliminating the progressive income tax and replacing them with a regressive consumption tax, and is a proponent of widespread economic deregulation and privatization (including the privatization of prisons).

Libertarianism may sound good on paper — championing individualism and maximum freedom; but in practice, its laissez faire prescriptions would result in corporate tyranny, the very opposite of freedom (libertarians are so consumed with the threat of state tyranny that they seem unable to even consider the very real threat of private tyranny, or as Noam Chomsky has described it, “tyranny by unaccountable private concentrations of wealth”). G. A. Cohen, the father of analytical Marxism and notable critic of libertarianism, discussed how private property actually inhibits the freedom of the ownerless in his essay “Capitalism, Freedom, Proletariat”: “Private property, like any system of rights, pretty well is a particular way of distributing freedom and unfreedom. It is necessarily associated with the liberty of private owners to do as they wish with what they own, but it no less necessarily withdraws liberty from those who do not own it. To think of capitalism as a realm of freedom is to overlook half of its nature.” Now, there was a time when the rugged individualism and minimal state intervention that libertarians advocate could have conceivably produced a greater degree of freedom: namely, in a pre-capitalist, pre-industrial economy — before the prevalence of wage-labor and the advent of multinational corporations, when independent producers (e.g. yeoman farmers, artisans, etc.) who sold their own commodities on the market (or simply produced for subsistence) were the dominant economic players. But in a modern corporate capitalist economy in which the richest 20 citizens control more wealth than the bottom half (about 152 million people in America), these notions are not only antiquated, but inimical to both freedom and democracy. Thus, a Bernie Sanders supporter would have to be grossly uninformed to go from backing the democratic socialist senator to a libertarian like Johnson. Yes, there are similarities between the two; but their political philosophies are so antithetical to each other — particularly when it comes to political economy — that the single issues where there is some agreement are basically irrelevant. Libertarianism is fundamentally opposed to the egalitarian and democratic values that Sanders represents.","Why Sanders supporters cannot back Gary Johnson: His libertarianism is antithetical to the senator’s Democratic socialism At the Libertarian Town Hall on CNN earlier this month, the Libertarian Party’s presidential candidate Gary Johnson and his running mate Bill Weld made a pitch to both “Never-Hillary” and “Never-Trump” voters on the left and right of the political spectrum as the sane and principled third-party alternative for 2016. And whether you agree or disagree with what the two former governors had to say, it’s hard to deny their likability — especially in an election where the two major party candidates are as thoroughly unlikable as Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.

219,Paul Ryan’s biggest early challenge: Finding a ‘routine’ as House speaker,"Paul D. Ryan is a bit of a control freak: Each day should have a similar rhythm, each meeting should begin on time, each day should end like the day before.

All of which makes his new job as speaker of the House, overseeing a raucous caucus of 246 Republicans, an odd fit for this very Type A personality. This past week was an early test. “I’m really kind of into routines, so I’m still working on getting a routine established,” Ryan (R-Wis.) told reporters Thursday in a roundtable discussion.

Ryan, 45, whose German mother instilled a rigid discipline in him, can’t even get over the fact that the speaker, by tradition, skips most House votes to conduct more meetings in office suites off the chamber floor: “I just like having routines, and I can get more done that way.”

With three weeks under his belt as speaker, Ryan has learned that the routine business of Congress can turn on a dime, for almost any reason. He’s aware that his words carry more weight now, and he’s aware that some weeks he’s not going to be able to live up to his promises of letting the House conduct business in a completely transparent fashion.

One week he was promoting a wide-open, free-flowing system of dozens of amendments for a highway funding plan, winning an impressive bipartisan vote. The next week brought the exact opposite, with a rushed bill to tighten safety requirements for Syrian refugees in the wake of terrorist attacks in Paris. No committee considered the legislation, no amendments were allowed, and the bill was made public about 40 hours before it was voted on by the House.

[House passes bill to tighten flow of Syrian refugees over Obama’s objection]

That inflicted whiplash on some lawmakers, but it demonstrated that Ryan understands that the ultimate judgment of his tenure will be based on results as much as, if not more than, the process used to achieve those results.

In the 35-minute session, Ryan said that the decision to rush the legislation — which calls for tighter screenings of refugees before they can be admitted — was actually driven by the lawmakers themselves. Despite their repeated outcries for an open process, once they saw the impact of terrorism in Paris, lawmakers reverted to their most basic political instinct and demanded that something be approved before they left Thursday for a 10-day recess over the Thanksgiving holiday.

“Most members said we need to act before we leave, we need to act before the recess,” Ryan said. “People came from intelligence briefings saying, ‘You need to do something.’ ”

So Ryan obliged, setting up a process he admitted was “outside the realm of regular order” and scored a big political win, getting more than a two-thirds majority, enough to overrule a presidential veto. He said that with so much fear of terrorist attacks, the public just needed to see Congress get something done.

“If we had a free-for-all on the floor, who knows what the outcome would be, and I think that the country is very worried and the country wants to see us doing something,” he said. But he also ran into some familiar partisan turbulence.

Despite Ryan’s assertion to have consulted Democrats, the ranking Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee said he had no part in the legislation and described it as a “gotcha bill” that will not make the nation any safer.

“We probably say things to get where we are, position-wise,” Rep. Bennie Thompson (Miss.) said after Thursday’s vote, during which nearly 50 Democrats rejected White House pleas and voted with Ryan. “But once we get there, it’s not nearly as easy to govern with new rules as we thought.”

The high-profile victory was an odd one for a new speaker who has staked so much of his reputation on advancing deep policy proposals, eschewing so-called show votes that are more designed to protect political flanks back home.

Even Ryan said that the real concern for national security was a visa waiver program that lacks proper protocols and the emerging threat of homegrown terrorists inspired by overseas events, and that those threats could make their way across the Atlantic Ocean.

“Common sense and prudence dictate that we be on higher alert and that we cannot assume that Paris was a one-and-done event,” he said.

House Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) mocked Ryan’s quick turnaround to flush a bill through the House so quickly, suggesting that the increasingly conservative tone of the Republican presidential primary campaign would “reflect” the congressional dysfunction and boost Democrats in next year’s elections. Some GOP presidential hopefuls called for a full stop of any Syrian refugees while some also called for allowing only Christian refugees.

The speaker said that his motivations were based on what he heard from House Republicans on Capitol Hill.

“I don’t even know all of their positions, to be candid,” he said of the presidential aspirants. “I’ve been busy doing my job.”

[Republican candidates move to keep Muslim refugees out]

The speaker’s newly fumigated office — the smoke-filled paint left behind by Camel-smoking John A. Boehner was chipped off, the carpet cleaned multiple times — has proven to be comfortable in the early days. “It smells better in here,” Ryan joked.

But once Congress returns after Thanksgiving, Ryan’s routine will revert to what the speaker dismissively calls “the chores”: passing a compromised version of the highway bill through the House and Senate, approving a new K-12 education program and finally, by Dec. 11, a massive funding plan for federal agencies.

Each of these issues is either many months, or many years, behind schedule, so Ryan views them as cleaning up other leaders’ messes. They will again test his ethos for opening up the House, a demand from the conservative flank that so bedeviled Boehner he became only the second speaker to resign midterm in the past 50 years.

He claims to be one of those far-right conservatives, that he is of their ilk and not trying to force them to bend to his will. “You have to understand, I come from the conservative wing of the party, I’m a movement conservative who comes from this part of our party. People know that, you know. So a lot of these guys are pretty good friends of mine,” he said.

If only he can figure out a routine, again, he might make it work.

“Time management has always been challenging. It’s just even more challenging,” he said, shaking his head. “I’m really weird about time management and punctuality, and I just want to make sure I can stay on top of those things.”","Paul Ryan’s biggest early challenge: Finding a ‘routine’ as House speaker Paul D.

6802,The SPLC’s Libelous New Report on 'Anti-Muslim Extremists',"The SPLC’s Libelous New Report on 'Anti-Muslim Extremists' Equating counter-jihadists with jihadists. Robert Spencer 
The objective of this libelous new report from the hard-Left money-making and incitement machine the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) is made plain within it: “Before you book a spokesperson from an anti-Muslim extremist group or quote them in a story, research their background — detailed in this in-depth guide to 15 of the most visible anti-Muslim activists— and consider the consequences of giving them a platform.” 
They wish to silence those who speak honestly about the nature and magnitude of the jihad threat, blaming us for a supposed rise in “Islamophobia.” If they really want to stamp out suspicion of Islam, of course, they will move against not us, but the likes of Omar Mateen, Syed Rizwan Farook, Tashfeen Malik, Nidal Malik Hasan, Mohammed Abdulazeez, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, and the myriad other Muslims who commit violence in the name of Islam and justify it by reference to Islamic teachings. 
The SPLC doesn’t do that because its objective is not really to stop “Islamophobia” at all, but to create the illusion of a powerful and moneyed network of “Islamophobes,” who can only be stopped if you write a check to the SPLC. That’s what this is really all about. 
In constructing this illusory edifice, the SPLC labels me and fourteen others “anti-Muslim extremists.” We are, of course, no more “anti-Muslim” than foes of the Nazis were anti-German, but note the word “extremists.” That’s the mainstream media and Obama administration’s term of choice for jihad terrorists. In what way are we “extremists”? Has anyone on the SPLC’s hit list (and given the SPLC’s track record of inciting violence against its targets, that is exactly what it is) ever blown anything or anyone up? Beheaded anyone? Boasted of our imminent conquest of any territory and the massacre of or enslavement of its people? No, all we have done is speak critically about jihad terror and Sharia oppression. The SPLC is trying to further the libel that we are the other side of the coin, the non-Muslim bin Ladens and Awlakis. Until we commit any terror attacks or conspire with others to do so, however, the SPLC’s libel is only that: a libel. 
It’s also passingly ironic that the SPLC list includes several people who are doubtless horrified to be in this company, as they have endeavored for years to distinguish their message from that of those whom they themselves would smear as “Islamophobes.” But their temporizing and pandering didn’t work: they ended up on the Index of Prohibited Thinkers anyway, as will, ultimately, anyone who dares to note that Islam just might have something to do with the acts of murder committed in its name and in accord with its teachings. 
The “report” as a whole stands as an example of the Left’s strange tendency to present true statements as if they were self-evidently false, without bothering to explain why. Apparently the SPLC knows its supporters and is aware that it doesn’t need to bother with troublesome things like, you know, facts. 
The SPLC’s hit list recurrently excoriates people for making true statements that it apparently regards as self-evidently false. For example, it says that Ann Corcoran of Refugee Resettlement Watch “accuses immigrant-run stores of illegally trafficking in food stamps.” This is a case that Corcoran makes with evidence – evidence that the SPLC doesn’t bother to try disproving. It says that Steven Emerson of the Investigative Project on Terrorism “has claimed that the Obama administration ‘extensively collaborates’ with the Muslim Brotherhood.” That he actually has done so doesn’t seem to bother them. As Andrew C. McCarthy has noted , “Barack Obama has spent his presidency cultivating Islamists, particularly from the international Muslim Brotherhood and its affiliates in the United States.” The SPLC also hits Emerison for having “asserted that Europe is riddled with ‘no-go zones.’” Regarding “no-go zones,” here are some news articles from just the past few weeks: 
Germany: Police “sick” of citizens’ no-go zone fears 
The SPLC excoriates Brigitte Gabriel of ACT for America for saying that any “practicing Muslim who believes the word of the Koran to be the word of Allah … who goes to mosque and prays every Friday, who prays five times a day — this practicing Muslim, who believes in the teachings of the Koran, cannot be a loyal citizen of the United States.” Yet it says nothing, of course, about the many teachings of the Qur’an that contradict American Constitutional principles: the denial of the freedom of speech, the death penalty for apostasy, the devaluation of women, and more. How to reconcile these teachings with U.S. citizenship, the SPLC did not bother to explain. 
The SPLC quotes David Horowitz saying: “There are only a couple of degrees of separation between anybody on the left and the terrorists — and that includes people in the Democratic Party, even those who are anti-terrorist.” Here again, no refutation is offered – yet the Left’s dalliance with Palestinian jihad groups and overall anti-Americanism make it impossible to dismiss Horowitz’s assertion. 
Frank Gaffney of the Center for Security Policy, we’re told, “is gripped by paranoid fantasies about Muslims destroying the West from within.” The SPLC doesn’t bother to mention the Explanatory Memorandum on the General Strategic Goal for the Brotherhood in North America , the captured Muslim Brotherhood internal document that explained that Brotherhood members “must understand that their work in America is a kind of grand Jihad in eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within and ‘sabotaging’ its miserable house by their hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and God’s religion is made victorious over all other religions.” 
In attacking Pamela Geller of the American Freedom Defense Initiative, the SPLC descended to outright fabrications. Notes Geller : “Their claim that I insist that Obama is the ‘love child’ of Malcolm X is patently untrue. The SPLC also states that I ‘have spoken to a neo-fascist group in Germany,’ when in fact I have never even been to Germany.” It characterizes former FBI agent John Guandolo’s claim that CIA director John Brennan was a convert to Islam as an “outlandish accusation,” when in fact “a U.S. asset assigned overseas with Brennan in Saudi Arabia when he was station chief confirmed years ago their firsthand account that Brennan was indeed the target of a Saudi intelligence influence operation that led to his conversion. Brennan has also stated publicly that he visited Mecca, which is impossible for a non-Muslim to do unless he is a special guest of the Saudi King.” 
Even more strangely, the SPLC targets Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a woman who grew up as a Muslim in Somalia, suffered genital mutilated at the hands of Muslims, is under death threats from Muslims, and lives in exile from her homeland because of Muslims. Instead of trying to discredit her, the SPLC should be honoring her for her stand for human rights against Sharia oppression. But the SPLC has other priorities. 
Of me, the SPLC concedes that I am a “real intellectual” but complains that I am “entirely self-taught in the study of Islam.” An odd objection. One cannot be both “self-taught” and a “real intellectual”? In any case, it’s false: I am indeed mostly self-taught in the study of Islam, and make no secret of or apologies for it; every day’s headlines proves me correct. Nonetheless, the fact is that I did first read the Qur’an and began studying Islam in earnest while at the University of North Carolina. My claims, says the SPLC, are “provably false,” but then only offers a number of them that are demonstrably true, without any attempt to refute them. 
It even says that I have “referred to Barack Obama as ‘the first Muslim president.’” This one epitomizes the dishonesty of the SPLC. The quote comes from an article I wrote in 2007 discussing how Obama was not a Muslim, stating that his obvious affinity for Islam and the Muslim world could make him into “our first Muslim president” the way Bill Clinton was called “our first black president.” After eight years of Obama, I’d say I was proven correct in rather spectacular fashion. 
The SPLC, finally, hits me for having “even suggested that the media may be getting money to depict Muslims in a positive light.” 
The facts are once again deeply unfortunate for the SPLC: George Soros funded a report on “Islamophobia” on Twitter and gave $200,000 to the Center for American Progress for a defamatory report on alleged “Islamophobes.” He also spent $600,000 for favorable coverage of the Muslim migrant inundation, bought favorable coverage of the Iran deal , and bought “Islamophobia” propaganda after the San Bernardino jihad massacre. 
But what need does the SPLC have of facts? It knows its readers won’t check up on the veracity of its claims, but will accept them at face value, since the SPLC is of the camp of the saints, the enlightened and tolerant Left. Those who are outside that camp clearly have no rights that the SPLC feels bound to respect.","The SPLC’s Libelous New Report on 'Anti-Muslim Extremists' The SPLC’s Libelous New Report on 'Anti-Muslim Extremists' Equating counter-jihadists with jihadists.

In constructing this illusory edifice, the SPLC labels me and fourteen others “anti-Muslim extremists.” We are, of course, no more “anti-Muslim” than foes of the Nazis were anti-German, but note the word “extremists.” That’s the mainstream media and Obama administration’s term of choice for jihad terrorists. In what way are we “extremists”? Has anyone on the SPLC’s hit list (and given the SPLC’s track record of inciting violence against its targets, that is exactly what it is) ever blown anything or anyone up? Beheaded anyone? Boasted of our imminent conquest of any territory and the massacre of or enslavement of its people? No, all we have done is speak critically about jihad terror and Sharia oppression. The SPLC is trying to further the libel that we are the other side of the coin, the non-Muslim bin Ladens and Awlakis. Until we commit any terror attacks or conspire with others to do so, however, the SPLC’s libel is only that: a libel. 
It’s also passingly ironic that the SPLC list includes several people who are doubtless horrified to be in this company, as they have endeavored for years to distinguish their message from that of those whom they themselves would smear as “Islamophobes.” But their temporizing and pandering didn’t work: they ended up on the Index of Prohibited Thinkers anyway, as will, ultimately, anyone who dares to note that Islam just might have something to do with the acts of murder committed in its name and in accord with its teachings. 
The “report” as a whole stands as an example of the Left’s strange tendency to present true statements as if they were self-evidently false, without bothering to explain why. Apparently the SPLC knows its supporters and is aware that it doesn’t need to bother with troublesome things like, you know, facts. 
The SPLC’s hit list recurrently excoriates people for making true statements that it apparently regards as self-evidently false. For example, it says that Ann Corcoran of Refugee Resettlement Watch “accuses immigrant-run stores of illegally trafficking in food stamps.” This is a case that Corcoran makes with evidence – evidence that the SPLC doesn’t bother to try disproving. It says that Steven Emerson of the Investigative Project on Terrorism “has claimed that the Obama administration ‘extensively collaborates’ with the Muslim Brotherhood.” That he actually has done so doesn’t seem to bother them. As Andrew C. McCarthy has noted , “Barack Obama has spent his presidency cultivating Islamists, particularly from the international Muslim Brotherhood and its affiliates in the United States.” The SPLC also hits Emerison for having “asserted that Europe is riddled with ‘no-go zones.’” Regarding “no-go zones,” here are some news articles from just the past few weeks: 
Germany: Police “sick” of citizens’ no-go zone fears 
The SPLC excoriates Brigitte Gabriel of ACT for America for saying that any “practicing Muslim who believes the word of the Koran to be the word of Allah … who goes to mosque and prays every Friday, who prays five times a day — this practicing Muslim, who believes in the teachings of the Koran, cannot be a loyal citizen of the United States.” Yet it says nothing, of course, about the many teachings of the Qur’an that contradict American Constitutional principles: the denial of the freedom of speech, the death penalty for apostasy, the devaluation of women, and more. How to reconcile these teachings with U.S. citizenship, the SPLC did not bother to explain. 
The SPLC quotes David Horowitz saying: “There are only a couple of degrees of separation between anybody on the left and the terrorists — and that includes people in the Democratic Party, even those who are anti-terrorist.” Here again, no refutation is offered – yet the Left’s dalliance with Palestinian jihad groups and overall anti-Americanism make it impossible to dismiss Horowitz’s assertion. 
Frank Gaffney of the Center for Security Policy, we’re told, “is gripped by paranoid fantasies about Muslims destroying the West from within.” The SPLC doesn’t bother to mention the Explanatory Memorandum on the General Strategic Goal for the Brotherhood in North America , the captured Muslim Brotherhood internal document that explained that Brotherhood members “must understand that their work in America is a kind of grand Jihad in eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within and ‘sabotaging’ its miserable house by their hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and God’s religion is made victorious over all other religions.” 
In attacking Pamela Geller of the American Freedom Defense Initiative, the SPLC descended to outright fabrications. Notes Geller : “Their claim that I insist that Obama is the ‘love child’ of Malcolm X is patently untrue. The SPLC also states that I ‘have spoken to a neo-fascist group in Germany,’ when in fact I have never even been to Germany.” It characterizes former FBI agent John Guandolo’s claim that CIA director John Brennan was a convert to Islam as an “outlandish accusation,” when in fact “a U.S. asset assigned overseas with Brennan in Saudi Arabia when he was station chief confirmed years ago their firsthand account that Brennan was indeed the target of a Saudi intelligence influence operation that led to his conversion. Brennan has also stated publicly that he visited Mecca, which is impossible for a non-Muslim to do unless he is a special guest of the Saudi King.” 
Even more strangely, the SPLC targets Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a woman who grew up as a Muslim in Somalia, suffered genital mutilated at the hands of Muslims, is under death threats from Muslims, and lives in exile from her homeland because of Muslims. Instead of trying to discredit her, the SPLC should be honoring her for her stand for human rights against Sharia oppression. But the SPLC has other priorities. 
Of me, the SPLC concedes that I am a “real intellectual” but complains that I am “entirely self-taught in the study of Islam.” An odd objection. One cannot be both “self-taught” and a “real intellectual”? In any case, it’s false: I am indeed mostly self-taught in the study of Islam, and make no secret of or apologies for it; every day’s headlines proves me correct. Nonetheless, the fact is that I did first read the Qur’an and began studying Islam in earnest while at the University of North Carolina. My claims, says the SPLC, are “provably false,” but then only offers a number of them that are demonstrably true, without any attempt to refute them. 
It even says that I have “referred to Barack Obama as ‘the first Muslim president.’” This one epitomizes the dishonesty of the SPLC. The quote comes from an article I wrote in 2007 discussing how Obama was not a Muslim, stating that his obvious affinity for Islam and the Muslim world could make him into “our first Muslim president” the way Bill Clinton was called “our first black president.” After eight years of Obama, I’d say I was proven correct in rather spectacular fashion. 
The SPLC, finally, hits me for having “even suggested that the media may be getting money to depict Muslims in a positive light.” 
The facts are once again deeply unfortunate for the SPLC: George Soros funded a report on “Islamophobia” on Twitter and gave $200,000 to the Center for American Progress for a defamatory report on alleged “Islamophobes.” He also spent $600,000 for favorable coverage of the Muslim migrant inundation, bought favorable coverage of the Iran deal , and bought “Islamophobia” propaganda after the San Bernardino jihad massacre. 
But what need does the SPLC have of facts? It knows its readers won’t check up on the veracity of its claims, but will accept them at face value, since the SPLC is of the camp of the saints, the enlightened and tolerant Left. Those who are outside that camp clearly have no rights that the SPLC feels bound to respect.","splc’s libelous new report anti-muslim extremist splc’s libelous new report anti-muslim extremist equate counter-jihadists jihadist robert spencer

6951,"Obama Administration Mandate Ordering ""Sex Change"" Surgeries Is Challenged","Email 
It has become increasingly apparent that the Obama administration looks upon the First Amendment protections of religious liberty as meaningless — if it contradicts its liberal social agenda. 
This is demonstrated in a recent mandate from the federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that physicians and other healthcare workers must perform surgeries to “alter” people's gender. Objections raised on the grounds that the physician views the surgery as harmful to the patient’s mental health, or that the surgeon has religious or ethical objections, do not matter. If surgeons refuse, they can face fines or even the loss of their jobs. 
The mandate includes surgeries on children. 
Thousands of healthcare providers and eight states are now challenging the validity of the federal rule. 
Obviously, Congress has never passed any such law, but HHS is exercising what is sometimes called “administrative law,” in which federal bureaucrats simply develop rules that implement a law — all according to the interpretation of the bureaucrats, of course. In this instance, the rule is said to apply to all private doctors, healthcare providers, and health insurance plans that accept federal funding, but it does not provide a religious exemption for medical personnel who find “sex-change operations” contrary to their religious beliefs. 
It is estimated that the rule will impact almost one million physicians and most hospitals in the United States — because almost every hospital receives some federal funds. (This is yet another example of how the federal government can use the threat of withholding federal monies to force compliance.) 
The transgender mandate’s legal “justification” is similar to that used in May when the Departments of Education and Justice ordered public schools and universities to allow transgender students to use the restroom and locker room they “identify” with, rather than the one that conforms to their biological sex. As in the present case, the Obama Education Department and Justice Department intend to get their way by threatening the loss of federal funds. 
To accomplish the order, the Obama administration simply redefined the meaning of the word “sex.” In an HHS rule that persons cannot be discriminated against because of their “sex,” the Obama administration claims that “sex” really means “gender.” And it argues that “gender” can be male, female, neither, or some combination thereof, which may be different from an individual’s sex at birth. In other words, when the doctor tells the baby’s parents, “It’s a boy,” or “It’s a girl,” perhaps they need to add “for the time being.” 
Using this reasoning, HHS is insisting that it is “sex discrimination” to refuse to perform a gender transition procedure. The healthcare professionals and states that have challenged the rule argue that the HHS regulation violates the U.S. Constitution and federal laws. 
The legal motion made by those seeking to overturn the rule states, “Thus, with a single stroke of the pen, HHS has created massive new liability for thousands of doctors unless they cast aside their convictions and perform procedures that can be deeply harmful to their patients.” About four dozen members of the U.S. House of Representatives sent a letter in October to HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell expressing their outrage about the regulation and asking her a dozen questions about the rule. 
Such a procedure is particularly irresponsible when performed upon children, if two recent studies on this subject are correct. According to the studies, as much as 94 percent of children who report “gender dysphoria” grow out of that discomfort. Gender dysphoria is defined as a discomfort a person may feel in regard to his or her biological sex. This means that in almost every case, the person eventually will accept his or her biological sex; however, if surgery has already been performed, the person is left in a tragic situation, all to conform to a radical social agenda. 
In Wichita Falls, Texas, federal judge Reed O'Connor issued an injunction on October 18 against the Obama administration’s transgender directive to schools. This ruling has encouraged a Christian association of more than 10,000 physicians and a Roman Catholic hospital system to ask the federal court in Wichita Falls to issue a similar injunction to block enforcement of the HHS regulation. Eight states have joined in the motion. 
The motion states that the rule “forces doctors and hospitals to perform controversial and potentially harmful medical procedures that purport to permanently alter an individual’s sex — even when doing so would violate a doctor’s religious beliefs and medical judgment, and even when the government’s own programs exclude the procedures as potentially harmful.”  ","Obama Administration Mandate Ordering ""Sex Change"" Surgeries Is Challenged Email

3003,Barack Obama says memory of Hiroshima 'must never fade',"Barack Obama called on the world to choose a future where Hiroshima was considered “the start of our own moral awakening”, as he became the first sitting US president to visit the Japanese city, 71 years after its bombing ushered in the nuclear age he vowed to bring to an end.

In a scene many survivors of the US bombing believed they would never live to see, Obama laid a floral wreath at a memorial to the dead of the world’s first atomic bombing, pausing in a moment of contemplation, his head slightly bowed.

He then paid tribute to the people of Hiroshima, calling on humanity to learn the lessons of the past to make war less likely.

“On a bright, cloudless morning, death fell from the sky and the world was changed,” he said, adding that humankind had shown that day it had the means to destroy itself.

“Why did we come to this place, to Hiroshima? We come to ponder a terrible force unleashed in the not so distant past. We come to mourn the dead,” he said.

“Their souls speak to us, they ask us to look inward, take stock of who we are.”

In a touching moment, Obama embraced Shigeaki Mori, a 79-year-old survivor who appeared overcome with emotion.

“The president gestured as if he was going to give me a hug, so we hugged,” said Mori, who spent decades tracing the families of 12 American POWs who died in the attack and ensured their deaths were officially recognised.



Obama also chatted to Sunao Tsuboi, the 91-year-old head of a survivors group, who thanked the president for his visit, but reminded him of his responsibility to act on his desire, first made in Prague in 2009, to bring about a world without nuclear weapons.

Obama urged the world to “choose a future when Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not considered the dawn of atomic warfare but as the start of our own moral awakening.”

He said: “Technological progress without equivalent progress in human institutions can doom us. The scientific revolution that led to the splitting of the atom requires a moral revolution as well.

“This is why we come to this place, we stand here, in the middle of this city and force ourselves to imagine the moment the bomb fell.

“We force ourselves to feel the dread of children confused by what they see. We listen to a silent cry.

“Some day, the voices will no longer be with us to bear witness, but the memory must never fade. That memory fuels our imagination. It allows us to change.”



His address included mention of the tens of thousands of Koreans – many of them forced labourers – who died in the attack, as well as the American dead.

In the distance stood the burned-out shell of the Atomic Bomb Dome – a peace memorial that is the most potent physical symbol of Hiroshima’s tragic past and its recovery from the ashes of war.



As expected, Obama did not offer an apology for the decision by his predecessor, Harry Truman, to unleash an atomic bomb over the city. The attack at the end of the second world war on 6 August 1945 killed an estimated 80,000 people soon after the blast. By the end of the year, the death toll had reached 140,000.

Obama and Tsuboi laughed at one point, the president smiling broadly. But mostly he listened, holding the elderly man’s hand in his own, an interpreter standing nearby. Tsuboi stamped his cane emphatically while speaking.

Obama was accompanied by the Japanese prime minister, Shinzō Abe, whose presence, Obama said ahead of the visit, would “highlight the extraordinary alliance” the US had created during the seven decades since the end of the war.

After looking at some of the exhibits in the peace museum, Obama wrote in the visitors’ book: “We have known the agony of war. Let us now find the courage, together, to spread peace, and pursue a world without nuclear weapons” – a goal he conceded he may not see in his lifetime.



Abe described Obama’s visit as “courageous”, saying: “An American president has come into contact with the reality of an atomic bombing and renewed his resolve toward realising a world without nuclear weapons.

“I sincerely welcome this historic visit, which has long been awaited by not only the people of Hiroshima, but by all Japanese people.”

Kaneko Izumi, a Hiroshima resident who was among the hundreds of people who filled the peace park in the evening to pay their respects to the victims, said Obama’s speech had offered hope to ageing survivors “who have been waiting most of their lives for an American president to come here”.

Not all residents were satisfied with the president’s speech, however. “I’m afraid I did not hear anything concrete about how he plans to achieve the abolition of nuclear weapons,” said Miki Tsukishita, who was five years old when the bomb was dropped. “Just cheering his visit is not enough. He is a serving US president ... I wish he had been more specific.”

Obama had long held the desire to go to Hiroshima, despite the potential for the visit to cause controversy in the US.

While many Japanese consider the attack a war crime – yet recognise the part their country’s militarist leaders played in bringing it about – the consensus in the US is that the attack hastened the end of the Pacific war, saving many more American and Japanese lives.

Japan surrendered on 15 August, less than a week after the US dropped a second atomic bomb, on the western port city of Nagasaki, killing more than 70,000 people. Obama said during a visit to Japan in late 2009 that he would be honoured to go to Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

“I certainly would be honoured – it would be meaningful for me to visit those two cities in the future,” he said.

Before Friday, the only western leader to have visited Hiroshima while in office was Kevin Rudd, who laid a wreath at the peace park cenotaph in 2008 when he was Australian prime minister.

Jimmy Carter visited the atomic bomb memorial in Hiroshima in 1984, after he had left office, but no sitting US president has ever visited the city. The highest-ranking US official to visit the site was Nancy Pelosi in 2008 when she was House speaker. The ambassador, Caroline Kennedy, attended the 70th anniversary commemorations last year.

The White House reportedly decided to proceed with the visit after the largely positive reaction to John Kerry’s tribute to the victims of the Hiroshima bombing on the sidelines of the G7 foreign ministers’ meeting last month.

Ahead of Friday’s visit, Obama told US Marines and members of the Japanese military at the Iwakuni base in western Japan how it was “a testament to how even the most painful divides can be bridged. How two nations can become not just partners but the best of friends”.



His trip, he said, was an “opportunity to honour the memory of all who were lost in world war two” but also had a message for today.

“I do think that part of the reason I’m going is because I want to once again underscore the very real risks that are out there and the sense of urgency that we all should have,” Obama said.

“So it’s not only a reminder of the terrible toll of world war two and the death of innocents across continents, but it’s also to remind ourselves that the job is not done in reducing conflict, building institutions of peace, and reducing the prospect of nuclear war in the future.”

While polls showed most Japanese welcomed Obama’s gesture, other countries in the region warned against allowing the visit to reinforce a one-dimensional view of Japan’s role in the second world war.

The Chinese foreign ministry said Japan should not forget the “grave suffering” it inflicted on its neighbours during the war.

“We hope Japan can take a responsible attitude toward its own people and the international community, and earnestly take history as a mirror to avoid a recurrence of the tragedy of the war,” ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters.

The state-run China Daily went much further, claiming the “atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were of Japan’s own making”.

In an editorial on the eve of the visit, the paper accused Japan of “trying to portray Japan as the victim of world war two rather than one of its major perpetrators”.

The bombing of both Hiroshima and Nagasaki was justified, the China Daily said, as “a bid to bring an early end to the war and prevent protracted warfare from claiming even more lives”.

It added: “It was the war of aggression the Japanese militarist government launched against its neighbours and its refusal to accept its failure that had led to US dropping the atomic bombs.”","Barack Obama says memory of Hiroshima 'must never fade' Barack Obama called on the world to choose a future where Hiroshima was considered “the start of our own moral awakening”, as he became the first sitting US president to visit the Japanese city, 71 years after its bombing ushered in the nuclear age he vowed to bring to an end.

6855,Good News! First Sanctuary For Abused Circus Elephants Opens In Brazil,"Elephant Sanctuary Brazil is located on a 2,800-acre plot of land and will be home to 50 rescued circus elephants. By Amanda Froelich 
The glitz and glamor of a circus show might make it appear as if an elephant’s life with the troupe is a joyous one, but nothing could be further from the truth. After an elephant is domesticated and trained (aka – ‘ has its spirit broken ’), it spends the majority of its days in chains , is poked and prodded to perform crowd-pleasing feats, and often suffers injuries which result from living in abnormal conditions. Additionally, it’s not unusual for circus beasts to be beaten by their trainers .
Every now and again, fortunately, elephants made to perform for the purpose of entertaining humans are removed from the circus and relocated to sanctuaries. There, they are able to live among their kind and enjoy life on their terms. And now that the first elephant sanctuary in all of Latin America has opened, this is likely to become a reality for many more of the gargantuan land mammals.
Elephant Sanctuary Brazil will be located on a 2,800-acre plot of land. Located in Chapada dos Guimarães, Mato Grosso, the sanctuary will host 50 rescued circus animals. Animal rights activists secured the location for $1 million and are actively seeking elephants to take in.
According to GoodNewsNetwork , the first two elephants to find sanctuary were Guida and Maia, who are believed to have been rescued from Thailand where they performed in circuses. While the sanctuary will not be available to the public, it will post updates about the well-being of rescued elephants via Facebook and through the Global Elephant Sanctuary website .

3548,"Al Qaeda leaders say group near collapse amid rise of ISIS, report claims","Two of Al Qaeda's spiritual leaders have said that the terror organization is barely functioning after losing money and manpower to the rapidly rising Islamic State group, according to a report.

Abu Qatada and Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi have described Al Qaeda as being without ""organizational structure,"" the Guardian reports. Maqdisi said Al Qaeda leader Ayman Al-Zawahiri is isolated from his top lieutenants and ""operates solely based on the allegiance.

""There is no organizational structure. There is only communication channels, and loyalty,"" he reportedly said.

Qatada, who was deported to Jordan from Britain in 2013 to face terrorism charges, also acknowledges that ISIS has gotten the better of Al Qaeda in the propaganda wars as well as those fought on the battlefield.

The Guardian report traces the beginning of Al Qaeda's downfall to the ascension of Zawahiri as Al Qaeda's leader following the death of Usama bin Laden in May 2011. While Zawahiri has been forced to move in secret in the remote mountain regions along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, hundreds of thousands of militants have flocked to the new battlefields in Syria and Iraq.

""What is leadership,"" asked Dr. Munif Samara, an Al Qaeda associate quoted in the report, ""if your leader is in Afghanistan and your soldiers are in Iraq?""

In April 2013, the report claims, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who had been chosen as the leader of what was then called the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) in 2010 without bin Laden's consent, announced that ISI and the Syrian rebel group the Nusra Front would merge to form ISIS. In response, Zawahiri ordered Beghdadi to restrict his operations to Iraq and said that Nusra Front commander Muhammad al-Joulani would lead Al Qaeda's official branch in Syria.

According to the report, Baghdadi rebuffed Zawahiri's decision, launching his own campaign of terror with the help of escaped prisoners from Iraqi jails and a massive influx of foreign fighters who had come to Syria to join the civil conflict aimed at overthrowing Syrian President Bashar Assad.

The following summer, ISIS overran large swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria, including the cities of Mosul and Tikrit, as the Iraqi Army fled. It now has a global network of affiliates that stretches from Afghanistan to West Africa, and they have set about making their presence known through their own brand of terror.

Last week, an Afghan Army corps spokesman told The New York Times that 10 Taliban fighters had been beheaded by ISIS fighters. Meanwhile, in eastern Libya, militants linked to Al Qaeda there declared holy war — or jihad — on the local ISIS affiliate after one of their senior leaders was killed Wednesday by masked gunmen. That sparked an hours-long battle in the coastal city of Darna that left 11 people dead on both sides.

Meanwhile, Al Qaeda's standing and finances continue to suffer. A former Al Qaeda member-turned-British intelligence agent tells the Guardian that at one point last year, the group was in such desperate times that it had to sell its laptops and cars to buy food and pay rent.

The Associated Press contributed to this report.

2050,Who’s ruling out a 2016 bid?,"(CNN) – On CNN’s “State of the Union,” four governors were asked Sunday whether they want to rule out a presidential bid.

Republican Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, considered a dark horse for the 2016 presidential race, didn’t directly answer the question.

 

 Follow @politicalticker Follow @KilloughCNN

“I haven't spent one second thinking about any job other than the one I was hired to do,” he told CNN’s chief political correspondent, Candy Crowley.

For his answer, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who’s openly considering a 2016 presidential run, simply said “no.”

The outgoing Republican governor, who ran in the GOP presidential primary last cycle, is heading to Iowa again next week, sparking further speculation that he has his eyes on another national campaign. Perry also visited the state, which holds the first presidential primary contest, in November.

Gov. Jay Nixon, D-Missouri, said he’s focused on his job as governor, adding that he’s hopeful former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton jumps in.

“We'll look forward to working with her, but we really do have a lot to get done in the next three years in the Show-Me State,” he said.

Democratic Gov. Dan Malloy of Connecticut was more direct in his response: “I am not going to be a candidate for president.”

Malloy is eligible to run for re-election this year but has not announced whether he plans to seek another term

4210,Abortion gaffes show Trump is the left-wing caricature of a conservative,"In the wake of Donald Trump’s abortion gaffes, it should finally be clear that Trump is not a real conservative — he is the liberal caricature of a conservative.

In his now infamous interview with Chris Matthews, Trump not only declared that if abortion became illegal women who have abortions should face “some form of punishment,” but also asserted that “conservatives, Republicans would say, yes they should be punished.”

No, they would not.

This is not something a real pro-life conservative would say; it is something a liberal pretending to be a pro-life conservative would say.

Anyone remotely familiar with the pro-life cause knows that its advocates don’t want to punish women. Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, explains that the focus of laws restricting abortion “is on protection, not punishment. Women were not punished by the legal system before 1973’s Roe v. Wade decision and there is absolutely no drive to punish her now.” As Mother Teresa famously put it, “Abortion is profoundly anti-women. Three quarters of its victims are women: Half the babies and all the mothers.”

Trump does not understand this, because he is deeply unfamiliar with what motivates pro-life Americans. The goal of the pro-life movement is to create a “culture of life” that upholds the dignity of every human person from conception to natural death. The objective is not punishment; it is to protect both mother and child.

Since Trump does not actually understand what pro-life conservatives truly believe, he mindlessly echoes the liberal caricature of pro-life conservatives. He mistakenly thinks this is what these conservatives want to hear. They don’t. This is, however, what liberals want to hear. They want a Republican candidate who feeds their false “war on women” narrative. They want to run against the caricature of the pro-life position, because the caricature is ugly. And Trump is giving them precisely what they want.

If that were not bad enough, Trump then went on to compound his problems by reversing himself. In an interview with John Dickerson on “Face the Nation,” Trump said that he would not change the law to protect innocent unborn life, declaring that “the laws are set. . . . At this moment, the laws are set. And I think we have to leave it that way.”

Leave it that way? This is something no pro-life conservative would say. It’s not even something a liberal pretending to be a pro-life conservative would say.

It’s something Hillary Clinton would say.

Trump then twice declined to answer when asked whether he thought abortion is murder, saying “I’d rather not comment on it” and “I just don’t think it’s an appropriate forum” before finally, on the third try, grudgingly saying “I don’t disagree.” Quite the profile in pro-life courage.

Trump likes to say he is a convert to the pro-life cause, just like Ronald Reagan. But Reagan would never have said that laws allowing abortion on demand should not be changed. As president, Reagan supported the “Human Life Bill,” which would have recognized the unborn as human beings and protected them as persons under our Constitution. Reagan would also never have said that women should be punished for having abortions. In his 1983 essay for the Human Life Review, “Abortion and the Conscience of a Nation,” Reagan declared: “We should not rest until our entire society echoes the tone of John Powell in the dedication of his book, ‘Abortion: The Silent Holocaust,’ a dedication to every woman carrying an unwanted child: ‘Please believe that you are not alone. There are many of us that truly love you, who want to stand at your side, and help in any way we can.’ ”

Much like when Trump referred to “Two Corinthians” instead of “Second Corinthians,” his comments on abortion are a “tell” demonstrating that he does not possess a basic understanding of the first principles that animate conservative thought on the sanctity of life.

So let’s stop the charade. When it comes to the issue of life, Donald Trump is a caricature, not a conservative.

In his 1983 essay for the Human Life Review, “Abortion and the Conscience of a Nation,” Reagan declared: “We should not rest until our entire society echoes the tone of John Powell in the dedication of his book, ‘Abortion: The Silent Holocaust,’ a dedication to every woman carrying an unwanted child: ‘Please believe that you are not alone. There are many of us that truly love you, who want to stand at your side, and help in any way we can.’ ”

Much like when Trump referred to “Two Corinthians” instead of “Second Corinthians,” his comments on abortion are a “tell” demonstrating that he does not possess a basic understanding of the first principles that animate conservative thought on the sanctity of life.

So let’s stop the charade. When it comes to the issue of life, Donald Trump is a caricature, not a conservative.

4414,"Dana Perino: Conservatives, here are 5 reasons why we should accept Facebook's olive branch","Wednesday, I participated in Facebook’s meeting with conservatives at the company’s headquarters in Silicon Valley.

Even though I did the round trip in a little more than 24 hours, the West Coast feels a long way away from New York City. Geographically and culturally.

The Facebook setting is so different from the work environments I’m used to, including its open floor plans to encourage the constant flow of creativity and its casual nature. The place is calm, but I had the feeling cool stuff was happening.

It’s different and, I’ll admit, a bit unnerving for someone who likes structure. But it’s also really neat. It’s powerful. And they know it.

Facebook invited 16 conservatives to a meeting it described as long overdue. Over time, the trust between conservatives and the company has been eroding.

Last week’s accusations from a former contract employee about the alleged  practice of suppressing conservative viewpoints and news stories in its Trending Topics feature was the spark that lit a fire.

The meeting was an attempt to put the fire out and to begin to rebuild trust with the conservative community.

This was a meeting where two bubbles collided: one of conservative media and activists and the other of the world of Facebook.

I went to the meeting with an open mind and a lot of curiosity. The Facebook executives we met with greeted us with humility and the admission that they need to do a better job.

Overall, the meeting went well. Here are my five takeaways:

1. Facebook recognized that it’s lost trust with conservatives and it is genuinely serious about fixing it.

While some in the conservative media worried that this meeting would be an insincere gesture and a mere photo-op (there were no cameras), the main company executives present -- including Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg -- could not have been more genuine.

It was very clear that Facebook does not take these allegations lightly, and they acknowledged a real trust deficit with their conservative partners and users.

I left feeling assured that Facebook would be working to repair relationships amidst the damaging allegations and to reestablish credibility in the conservative community about its commitment to inclusivity and neutrality.

Wednesday’s meeting was a civil environment where everyone had the opportunity to voice their opinions, concerns, and questions.

Imagine a meeting in 2016 where 16 different conservatives – representing all the different viewpoints we have – get along really well and are reminded of our common principles. (Maybe we should have the convention in Silicon Valley? OK, maybe in 2020).

Everyone had a chance to speak and did so frankly. And respectfully.

Zuckerberg and his team did way more listening than talking, which left the door open for a meaningful conversation. And, despite the uncomfortable temperature in the room (the power went out in the headquarters just as the meeting started), Zuckerberg kept the meeting going for an additional 20 minutes so that everyone had a chance to speak and get their questions answered or ideas raised.

3. Face-to-face is best for establishing trust.

Zuckerberg immediately acknowledged that this meeting was one he should have started long before.

He was right – and we can meet him halfway on that. But the fact that he invited all of us to Facebook’s headquarters allowed everyone to voice their concerns and opinions to each other in one room, face-to-face. That showed an immediate level of respect from Zuckerberg and his team, and the same was true of the conservatives that were there.

The conservatives were prepared, specific, smart, and creative.  This is an important thing to remember in business relationships, and even personal relationships.

4. Employment diversity is not limited to gender and ethnicity.

Facebook -- and Silicon Valley in general -- takes pride in their commitment to diversity among their employees. But a point that was made yesterday is that diversity in thought and opinion is critical as well for a well-rounded company.

Gender diversity and ethnic diversity are not the only ways to diversify, and Facebook clearly lacks conservative staffers. The company did not disagree.

5. Conservatives need to keep using all the available social media platforms.

Social media as a whole has been a boon for conservatives. Never before could a conservative reach that many people without a mainstream media filter.

Conservatives have built followings, movements, and even presidential campaigns utilizing Facebook.

Since the company has admitted it needs to do better, let’s take them up on that.

We can offer specific solutions and bring creative ideas. We can pick up the phone or get on a plane and meet with people – I found them to be reasonable and approachable. This may not always be the case, but it is the situation we have right now.

Conservatives want Facebook to be more responsive, and we are pushing on an open door. Let’s walk through it.

Being a conservative means fighting for individual liberty, freedom of expression and markets and for less government interference in our lives. By all accounts, a majority of Americans agree with those principles.

We should use all available tools at our disposal to spread that word and build a stronger conservative movement in the United States and around the world.

It’s different and, I’ll admit, a bit unnerving for someone who likes structure. But it’s also really neat. It’s powerful. And they know it.

Facebook invited 16 conservatives to a meeting it described as long overdue. Over time, the trust between conservatives and the company has been eroding.

Last week’s accusations from a former contract employee about the alleged  practice of suppressing conservative viewpoints and news stories in its Trending Topics feature was the spark that lit a fire.

The meeting was an attempt to put the fire out and to begin to rebuild trust with the conservative community.

This was a meeting where two bubbles collided: one of conservative media and activists and the other of the world of Facebook.

I went to the meeting with an open mind and a lot of curiosity. The Facebook executives we met with greeted us with humility and the admission that they need to do a better job.

Overall, the meeting went well. Here are my five takeaways:

1. Facebook recognized that it’s lost trust with conservatives and it is genuinely serious about fixing it.

While some in the conservative media worried that this meeting would be an insincere gesture and a mere photo-op (there were no cameras), the main company executives present -- including Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg -- could not have been more genuine.

It was very clear that Facebook does not take these allegations lightly, and they acknowledged a real trust deficit with their conservative partners and users.

I left feeling assured that Facebook would be working to repair relationships amidst the damaging allegations and to reestablish credibility in the conservative community about its commitment to inclusivity and neutrality.

Wednesday’s meeting was a civil environment where everyone had the opportunity to voice their opinions, concerns, and questions.

Imagine a meeting in 2016 where 16 different conservatives – representing all the different viewpoints we have – get along really well and are reminded of our common principles. (Maybe we should have the convention in Silicon Valley? OK, maybe in 2020).

Everyone had a chance to speak and did so frankly. And respectfully.

Zuckerberg and his team did way more listening than talking, which left the door open for a meaningful conversation. And, despite the uncomfortable temperature in the room (the power went out in the headquarters just as the meeting started), Zuckerberg kept the meeting going for an additional 20 minutes so that everyone had a chance to speak and get their questions answered or ideas raised.

3. Face-to-face is best for establishing trust.

Zuckerberg immediately acknowledged that this meeting was one he should have started long before.

He was right – and we can meet him halfway on that. But the fact that he invited all of us to Facebook’s headquarters allowed everyone to voice their concerns and opinions to each other in one room, face-to-face. That showed an immediate level of respect from Zuckerberg and his team, and the same was true of the conservatives that were there.

The conservatives were prepared, specific, smart, and creative.  This is an important thing to remember in business relationships, and even personal relationships.

4. Employment diversity is not limited to gender and ethnicity.

Facebook -- and Silicon Valley in general -- takes pride in their commitment to diversity among their employees. But a point that was made yesterday is that diversity in thought and opinion is critical as well for a well-rounded company.

Gender diversity and ethnic diversity are not the only ways to diversify, and Facebook clearly lacks conservative staffers. The company did not disagree.

5. Conservatives need to keep using all the available social media platforms.

Social media as a whole has been a boon for conservatives. Never before could a conservative reach that many people without a mainstream media filter.

Conservatives have built followings, movements, and even presidential campaigns utilizing Facebook.

Since the company has admitted it needs to do better, let’s take them up on that.

We can offer specific solutions and bring creative ideas. We can pick up the phone or get on a plane and meet with people – I found them to be reasonable and approachable. This may not always be the case, but it is the situation we have right now.

Conservatives want Facebook to be more responsive, and we are pushing on an open door. Let’s walk through it.

Being a conservative means fighting for individual liberty, freedom of expression and markets and for less government interference in our lives. By all accounts, a majority of Americans agree with those principles.

We should use all available tools at our disposal to spread that word and build a stronger conservative movement in the United States and around the world.

3159,How the GOP Went South,"While some on the Right want to downplay the race angle, others on the Left suggest that the entire success of the modern GOP was premised on exploiting Southern racism. Interestingly, though, much of what both sides think we know about this trend appears to be wrong. Elections analyst Sean Trende recently argued that “while the dominant narrative continues to insist that the South began to realign toward the Republicans in the wake of the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, in fact, Southern loyalties had begun to weaken during the presidency of Franklin Roosevelt.” As evidence, Trende notes that the South voted increasingly Republican every year of FDR’s presidency, and that although Eisenhower lost Dixie, he did so by only three points. What is more, while Eisenhower was gaining support in the South, he was simultaneously pushing civil rights legislation. So why did the South become increasingly Republican starting in the 1940s? According to Trende, “Southern whites simply became wealthy enough to start voting Republican.” This, of course, flies in the face of everything we think we know about why the South became solidly Republican. This is not to suggest that race wasn’t involved in the shift that really began to reach a tipping point after the ’60s, but it does suggest that history is more complex than the Reader’s Digest (or, rather, the Mother Jones) version many of us are taught in school.

After the post—Civil Rights Act “Dixiecrat” shift, economics and air‑conditioning conspired to send American voters fleeing the Rust Belt for the Sun Belt, further eroding the power of the Northeast Republican establishment, personified by the New York governors and presidential aspirants Thomas Dewey and Nelson Rockefeller. (This is a trend that is still under way; according to the U.S. census, the city of Austin, Texas—the liberal enclave in a deeply red state—was, by far, the fastest growing city in America from 2010 to 2013.) It’s unwise to write off an entire swath of the nation, but that’s just what Barry Goldwater, who represented Arizona in the U.S. Senate, seemed to do when he declared that “sometimes I think the country would be better off if we could just saw off the Eastern seaboard and let it float out to sea.” The Johnson campaign turned that line into a devastating ad in which the eastern side of a U.S. map, floating in water, is literally sawed off.

Truth be told, the South’s influence came to dominate both parties. Democrats soon saw that the only way they could win would be to cut into the GOP’s base. For a while, it looked like the only path to Democratic victory was through nominating a son of the South. From Texan Lyndon Johnson to Georgia peanut farmer Jimmy Carter to Arkansas’s Bill Clinton (and even to, yes, Al Gore), seemingly only Southern Democrats could win the White House—and even that trend was not very recent; consider Virginia‑born segregationist Woodrow Wilson or Harry Truman, the descendants of slaveholders and Confederate sympathizers, or even Warm Springs, Georgia, resident FDR. In the post‑Reagan years, Southerners so dominated both parties that at one point, we had a president from Arkansas (Clinton), a vice president from Tennessee (Gore), a Majority Leader from Mississippi (Trent Lott), and a House Speaker from Georgia (Newt Gingrich). The chairman of the GOP was Haley Barbour, from Mississippi. President George W. Bush of Texas, Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist of Tennessee, and House Majority Leaders Dick Armey and Tom DeLay (Texans) soon followed in what was, perhaps, the apex of Southern domination of the GOP, and simultaneously, of Republican triumphalism. Talk circulated that the GOP had achieved a “permanent governing majority.”

Ronald Reagan downplayed his intellectual and cosmopolitan credentials to accentuate his everyman persona. In similar fashion, Dwight Eisenhower, the former supreme commander of Allied forces in Europe and president of Columbia University, dodged questions by employing bumbling answers at press conferences. “In public he wore a costume of affability, optimism, and farm‑boy charm,” wrote David Brooks in The Road to Character. “As president, he was perfectly willing to appear stupider than he really was if it would help him perform his assigned role. He was willing to appear tongue‑tied if it would help him conceal his true designs.” Biographer Andrew Sinclair said much the same thing about the much‑maligned Warren Harding’s “mute your own horn” leadership style. In this regard, George W. Bush simply followed a long‑standing tradition—albeit with a Texas twang. Tevi Troy, the former Bush aide who authored What Jefferson Read, Ike Watched, and Obama Tweeted, believes that “Bush probably read more history than [Jack] Kennedy.” If that sounds absurd, it’s partly because Kennedy highlighted his intellectual credentials, while the Yale‑educated Bush downplayed his. As a result, we consider Kennedy (no dummy, but no genius, either) smarter. Is this only the result of a liberal media painting Republicans as illiterate Babbitts? Hardly. “To be fair,” Troy writes, “Bush was not blameless in acquiring a reputation for not reading.”

In 2000, the New York Times’ Nicholas Kristoff wrote that Kent Hance believes he “helped teach Mr. Bush the need to be more folksy.” As Mr. Hance put it, “He wasn’t going to be out‑Christianed or out‑good‑old‑boyed again.” If this is true (and one suspects it is), then it’s hard to fault Bush for doing what he had to do to win. And let’s not forget that he wasn’t just trying to forge his own comeback; he was also attempting to avenge his father’s defeat at the hands of Bill Clinton in 1992. What is more, his father, former President George H. W. Bush, had been mocked as a tax‑raiser and a preppy wimp. George W. Bush did everything possible to be the opposite of that. The adoption of the Texas persona helped, but the younger Bush overswaggered and overtwanged. But hey, he managed to win two elections, and winning is everything, right?

The problem was, although this is a bipartisan phenomenon, it just happens to have disproportionately impacted the Right. Again, Republicans are thought of as the stupid party. Both sides of the political aisle occasionally genuflect at the altar of rural superiority, even if Republicans are decidedly better at it. Although President Obama’s appeal to urbanites and minorities is obvious, he is not above the affectation of droppin’ his gs and prattlin’ on about “folks.” Likewise, prep school—bred John Kerry (“Can I get me a hunting license here?”) experimented with some downright, down‑home Forrest Gump elocution during his 2004 race. Hillary Clinton has been known to affect a Southern accent when convenient. Even less subtle was the over‑the‑top, twangy country music song “Stand With Hillary” released in late 2014—“Put your boots on and let’s smash this ceilin’ ”—where all the gs were dropped. The producer of the “Stand With Hillary” song also produced a 2008 viral mariachi video, “Viva Obama.” Nothing happens by accident in politics. Hillary’s pandering is a transparent attempt to woo the “real America.” Noting the dichotomy between Obama’s pop‑culture outreach—which featured the Will.I.Am song “Yes We Can” and Hillary’s—Ben Domenech, publisher of The Federalist website, observed, “The attempt to pander to the white working class voters left out by the Democratic agenda for so many years is obvious and clumsy, but also revealing, signaling their perception of what’s happened to the electorate in the course of the Obama era.”

For all the GOP’s problems, it is perhaps instructive to remember that Democrats also face their own challenges, which include struggles to win white votes—and their own gender gap with men. Putting aside politics, the notion that America should have one de facto white party and one de facto minority party strikes me as unhealthy. We should all resist this sort of racial balkanization. And, of course, just as Republicans confront regional geographic problems, the Democrats missed winning the White House in 2000, at least partly because Al Gore couldn’t deliver his home state of Tennessee. Just a dozen years ago, former senator Zell Miller, a conservative Democrat, penned a book titled A National Party No More, lamenting the fact that his beloved party had written off the South, and would continue to pay an electoral price. “Today, our national Democratic leaders look south and say, ‘I see one‑third of a nation and it can go to hell,’ ” he wrote. This is a good example of how political fortunes can quickly change. Just as Miller’s book hasn’t aged well (electorally speaking, the Democrats seem to have made the right political moves), a dozen years from now this book might seem antiquated. I won’t be at all upset if that happens. Still, almost all the long‑term trends (including demographic shifts and shifts in public opinion) seem to suggest the GOP is in trouble if it doesn’t adapt and overcome.

In the introduction of this book, I wrote about my rural background in western Maryland and the deep abiding respect I have for rural Americans who have done much to make this a great country. I don’t want to see an America where everyone is huddled into cities. In the words of Hank Williams Jr., we need Americans who still know how to “skin a buck” and “run a trotline.” But one of the many challenges confronting conservatives is that America has transitioned from the agrarian age to the industrial age to the information age. Unlike the industrial age, where the top‑down assembly line model favored liberals, the tech revolution may favor the rugged individualism embraced by libertarian‑leaning conservatives. Regardless, given these trends, it makes little sense for a movement or a party to allow the rural‑versus‑urban paradigm—and the many cultural issues tied up in that—to define and assign membership status. So long as Republicans could win this way, it made perfect sense to exploit the cleavage between city folks and “Real America.” Not only was this smart politics, but it also tapped into deep‑seated beliefs.

So where did this traditional deification of rural areas come from? Among other things, credit (or blame) the influence of religion (think the Garden of Eden versus the Tower of Babel), philosophy (Rousseau’s notion about noble savages, and later, transcendentalists like Ralph Waldo Emerson—and Walden Woods-loving Henry David Thoreau), and various ideas conceived during the time of America’s founding, such as Thomas Jefferson’s agrarianism. “I think our governments will remain virtuous for many centuries,” Jefferson wrote Madison, “as long as they are chiefly agricultural; and this will be as long as there shall be vacant lands in any part of America. When they get piled upon one another in large cities, as in Europe, they will become corrupt as in Europe.” This was bipartisan. Believe it or not, in the run‑up to his 1932 election, Groton‑ and Harvard‑educated Franklin Roosevelt enjoyed far more support from rural and Southern voters than with big‑city types—and painted himself not as a former Wall Street lawyer but rather as a simple “farmer.”

This brings us to a contradiction within conservatism. Much of conservatism—a belief in free markets, for instance—is premised on the dynamic notion that more people equal more ideas. But while optimistic free marketeers adhering to this Reagan and Kemp model subscribe to this theory, most populists do not. The more optimistic worldview made major strides when economists like Julian Simon and Ester Boserup took on the Malthusian catastrophe argument, which erroneously predicted that global overpopulation would lead to mass starvation, and demonstrated that more people equals more ideas, innovation, and prosperity. When you think about it, it makes sense. Rural societies tend to work on subsistence (you eat what you grow— be careful what you wish for, “local foods” advocates!), but cities, by their very nature, demand free market economic skills such as cooperation, specialization, and trade. These things make us rich. And cities are the areas where these things are appreciated and magnified. And let us not forget that great cities, after all, not only have fostered great hedge funds, but have also built great cathedrals stone by stone.

Leaders emerge during times of tragedy and crisis, and it was at this moment that Nikki Haley, the female, Indian American governor of South Carolina, who also happens to be a conservative Republican, seized the moment. “Today we are here in a moment of unity in our state without ill will to say it is time to remove the flag from our capitol grounds,” Haley said at a press conference on June 22, 2015. “This flag, while an integral part of our past, does not represent the future of our great state.” She was flanked by Republican senators Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott, who is one of only two African Americans in the U.S. Senate. And, in a way, the South Carolina governor and these senators represent a changing Republican Party, as well as a changing South. Graham, the only white representative, is probably the least conservative of the three. But they bring diverse perspectives that not very long ago were absent from Republican politics in the South. “The biggest reason I asked for that flag to come down was I couldn’t look my children in the face and justify it staying there,” Haley later told CNN’s Don Lemon. “What I realized now more than ever is people were driving by and they felt hurt and pain. No one should feel pain … My father wears a turban. My mother, at the time, wore a sari. It was hard growing up in South Carolina.”","How the GOP Went South While some on the Right want to downplay the race angle, others on the Left suggest that the entire success of the modern GOP was premised on exploiting Southern racism. Interestingly, though, much of what both sides think we know about this trend appears to be wrong. Elections analyst Sean Trende recently argued that “while the dominant narrative continues to insist that the South began to realign toward the Republicans in the wake of the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, in fact, Southern loyalties had begun to weaken during the presidency of Franklin Roosevelt.” As evidence, Trende notes that the South voted increasingly Republican every year of FDR’s presidency, and that although Eisenhower lost Dixie, he did so by only three points. What is more, while Eisenhower was gaining support in the South, he was simultaneously pushing civil rights legislation. So why did the South become increasingly Republican starting in the 1940s? According to Trende, “Southern whites simply became wealthy enough to start voting Republican.” This, of course, flies in the face of everything we think we know about why the South became solidly Republican. This is not to suggest that race wasn’t involved in the shift that really began to reach a tipping point after the ’60s, but it does suggest that history is more complex than the Reader’s Digest (or, rather, the Mother Jones) version many of us are taught in school.

After the post—Civil Rights Act “Dixiecrat” shift, economics and air‑conditioning conspired to send American voters fleeing the Rust Belt for the Sun Belt, further eroding the power of the Northeast Republican establishment, personified by the New York governors and presidential aspirants Thomas Dewey and Nelson Rockefeller. (This is a trend that is still under way; according to the U.S. census, the city of Austin, Texas—the liberal enclave in a deeply red state—was, by far, the fastest growing city in America from 2010 to 2013.) It’s unwise to write off an entire swath of the nation, but that’s just what Barry Goldwater, who represented Arizona in the U.S. Senate, seemed to do when he declared that “sometimes I think the country would be better off if we could just saw off the Eastern seaboard and let it float out to sea.” The Johnson campaign turned that line into a devastating ad in which the eastern side of a U.S. map, floating in water, is literally sawed off.

Truth be told, the South’s influence came to dominate both parties. Democrats soon saw that the only way they could win would be to cut into the GOP’s base. For a while, it looked like the only path to Democratic victory was through nominating a son of the South. From Texan Lyndon Johnson to Georgia peanut farmer Jimmy Carter to Arkansas’s Bill Clinton (and even to, yes, Al Gore), seemingly only Southern Democrats could win the White House—and even that trend was not very recent; consider Virginia‑born segregationist Woodrow Wilson or Harry Truman, the descendants of slaveholders and Confederate sympathizers, or even Warm Springs, Georgia, resident FDR. In the post‑Reagan years, Southerners so dominated both parties that at one point, we had a president from Arkansas (Clinton), a vice president from Tennessee (Gore), a Majority Leader from Mississippi (Trent Lott), and a House Speaker from Georgia (Newt Gingrich). The chairman of the GOP was Haley Barbour, from Mississippi. President George W. Bush of Texas, Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist of Tennessee, and House Majority Leaders Dick Armey and Tom DeLay (Texans) soon followed in what was, perhaps, the apex of Southern domination of the GOP, and simultaneously, of Republican triumphalism. Talk circulated that the GOP had achieved a “permanent governing majority.”

Ronald Reagan downplayed his intellectual and cosmopolitan credentials to accentuate his everyman persona. In similar fashion, Dwight Eisenhower, the former supreme commander of Allied forces in Europe and president of Columbia University, dodged questions by employing bumbling answers at press conferences. “In public he wore a costume of affability, optimism, and farm‑boy charm,” wrote David Brooks in The Road to Character. “As president, he was perfectly willing to appear stupider than he really was if it would help him perform his assigned role. He was willing to appear tongue‑tied if it would help him conceal his true designs.” Biographer Andrew Sinclair said much the same thing about the much‑maligned Warren Harding’s “mute your own horn” leadership style. In this regard, George W. Bush simply followed a long‑standing tradition—albeit with a Texas twang. Tevi Troy, the former Bush aide who authored What Jefferson Read, Ike Watched, and Obama Tweeted, believes that “Bush probably read more history than [Jack] Kennedy.” If that sounds absurd, it’s partly because Kennedy highlighted his intellectual credentials, while the Yale‑educated Bush downplayed his. As a result, we consider Kennedy (no dummy, but no genius, either) smarter. Is this only the result of a liberal media painting Republicans as illiterate Babbitts? Hardly. “To be fair,” Troy writes, “Bush was not blameless in acquiring a reputation for not reading.”

In 2000, the New York Times’ Nicholas Kristoff wrote that Kent Hance believes he “helped teach Mr. Bush the need to be more folksy.” As Mr. Hance put it, “He wasn’t going to be out‑Christianed or out‑good‑old‑boyed again.” If this is true (and one suspects it is), then it’s hard to fault Bush for doing what he had to do to win. And let’s not forget that he wasn’t just trying to forge his own comeback; he was also attempting to avenge his father’s defeat at the hands of Bill Clinton in 1992. What is more, his father, former President George H. W. Bush, had been mocked as a tax‑raiser and a preppy wimp. George W. Bush did everything possible to be the opposite of that. The adoption of the Texas persona helped, but the younger Bush overswaggered and overtwanged. But hey, he managed to win two elections, and winning is everything, right?

The problem was, although this is a bipartisan phenomenon, it just happens to have disproportionately impacted the Right. Again, Republicans are thought of as the stupid party. Both sides of the political aisle occasionally genuflect at the altar of rural superiority, even if Republicans are decidedly better at it. Although President Obama’s appeal to urbanites and minorities is obvious, he is not above the affectation of droppin’ his gs and prattlin’ on about “folks.” Likewise, prep school—bred John Kerry (“Can I get me a hunting license here?”) experimented with some downright, down‑home Forrest Gump elocution during his 2004 race. Hillary Clinton has been known to affect a Southern accent when convenient. Even less subtle was the over‑the‑top, twangy country music song “Stand With Hillary” released in late 2014—“Put your boots on and let’s smash this ceilin’ ”—where all the gs were dropped. The producer of the “Stand With Hillary” song also produced a 2008 viral mariachi video, “Viva Obama.” Nothing happens by accident in politics. Hillary’s pandering is a transparent attempt to woo the “real America.” Noting the dichotomy between Obama’s pop‑culture outreach—which featured the Will.I.Am song “Yes We Can” and Hillary’s—Ben Domenech, publisher of The Federalist website, observed, “The attempt to pander to the white working class voters left out by the Democratic agenda for so many years is obvious and clumsy, but also revealing, signaling their perception of what’s happened to the electorate in the course of the Obama era.”

after post—civil right act “dixiecrat” shift economics air‑conditioning conspire send american voter flee rust belt sun belt erode power northeast republican establishment personify new york governor presidential aspirant thomas dewey nelson rockefeller trend still way accord u.s census city austin texas—the liberal enclave deeply red state—was far fast grow city america it’s unwise write entire swath nation that’s barry goldwater represent arizona u.s senate seem declared “sometimes think country would better could saw eastern seaboard let float sea.” johnson campaign turn line devastate ad eastern side u.s map float water literally saw off.

ronald reagan downplay intellectual cosmopolitan credential accentuate everyman persona similar fashion dwight eisenhower former supreme commander ally force europe president columbia university dodge question employ bumble answer press conference “in public wore costume affability optimism farm‑boy charm,” write david brook road character “as president perfectly willing appear stupider really would help perform assigned role willing appear tongue‑tied would help conceal true designs.” biographer andrew sinclair say much thing much‑maligned warren harding’s “mute horn” leadership style regard george w bush simply follow long‑standing tradition—albeit texas twang tevi troy former bush aide author jefferson read ike watched obama tweet believe “bush probably read history jack kennedy.” sound absurd it’s partly kennedy highlight intellectual credential yale‑educated bush downplay result consider kennedy dummy genius either smarter result liberal medium paint republican illiterate babbitt hardly “to fair,” troy write “bush blameless acquire reputation reading.”

in new york times’ nicholas kristoff write kent hance believe “helped teach mr bush need folksy.” mr hance put “he wasn’t go out‑christianed out‑good‑old‑boyed again.” true one suspect it’s hard fault bush win let’s forget wasn’t try forge comeback also attempt avenge father’s defeat hand bill clinton father former president george h w bush mock tax‑raiser preppy wimp george w bush everything possible opposite adoption texas persona help young bush overswaggered overtwanged hey manage win two election win everything right?

the problem although bipartisan phenomenon happen disproportionately impact right republican think stupid party side political aisle occasionally genuflect altar rural superiority even republicans decidedly well although president obama’s appeal urbanites minority obvious affectation droppin’ g prattlin’ “folks.” likewise prep school—bred john kerry “can get hunt license here?” experiment downright down‑home forrest gump elocution race hillary clinton know affect southern accent convenient even less subtle over‑the‑top twangy country music song “stand hillary” release late boot let’s smash ceilin’ ”—where g drop producer “stand hillary” song also produce viral mariachi video “viva obama.” nothing happen accident politics hillary’s pander transparent attempt woo “real america.” note dichotomy obama’s pop‑culture outreach—which feature will.i.am song “yes can” and hillary’s—ben domenech publisher federalist website observe “the attempt pander white work class voter leave democratic agenda many year obvious clumsy also reveal signal perception what’s happen electorate course obama era.”

for gop’s problem perhaps instructive remember democrat also face challenge include struggle win white votes—and gender gap men put aside politics notion america one de facto white party one de facto minority party strike unhealthy resist sort racial balkanization course republicans confront regional geographic problem democrat miss win white house least partly al gore couldn’t deliver home state tennessee dozen year ago former senator zell miller conservative democrat pen book title national party lament fact beloved party write south would continue pay electoral price “today national democratic leader look south say ‘i see one‑third nation go hell,’ write good example political fortune quickly change miller’s book hasn’t age well electorally speak democrat seem make right political move dozen year book might seem antiquate won’t upset happens still almost long‑term trend include demographic shift shift public opinion seem suggest gop trouble doesn’t adapt overcome.

in introduction book write rural background western maryland deep abide respect rural american do much make great country don’t want see america everyone huddle city word hank williams jr need american still know “skin buck” “run trotline.” one many challenge confront conservative america transition agrarian age industrial age information age unlike industrial age top‑down assembly line model favor liberal tech revolution may favor rugged individualism embrace libertarian‑leaning conservative regardless give trend make little sense movement party allow rural‑versus‑urban paradigm—and many cultural issue tie that—to define assign membership status long republican could win way make perfect sense exploit cleavage city folk “real america.” smart politics also tap deep‑seated beliefs.

so traditional deification rural area come among thing credit blame influence religion think garden eden versus tower babel philosophy rousseau’s notion noble savage later transcendentalist like ralph waldo emerson—and walden woods-loving henry david thoreau various idea conceive time america’s found thomas jefferson’s agrarianism “i think government remain virtuous many centuries,” jefferson write madison “as long chiefly agricultural long shall vacant land part america get pile upon one another large city europe become corrupt europe.” bipartisan believe run‑up election groton‑ harvard‑educated franklin roosevelt enjoy far support rural southern voter big‑city types—and paint former wall street lawyer rather simple “farmer.”

this bring u contradiction within conservatism much conservatism—a belief free market instance—is premised dynamic notion people equal idea optimistic free marketeers adhere reagan kemp model subscribe theory populist optimistic worldview make major stride economist like julian simon ester boserup take malthusian catastrophe argument erroneously predict global overpopulation would lead mass starvation demonstrate people equal idea innovation prosperity think make sense rural society tend work subsistence eat grow— careful wish “local foods” advocate city nature demand free market economic skill cooperation specialization trade thing make u rich city area thing appreciate magnified let u forget great city foster great hedge fund also build great cathedral stone stone.

A migrant turf war erupted into violence on the streets of one of Paris’ trendiest neighbourhoods early this morning as asylum seekers beat each other to a pulp with wooden clubs. 
The area around Stalingrad Metro station was turned into a refugee battleground as rival gangs of migrants set upon each other in shocking scenes of violence. 
Asylum seekers wearing hooded tops wielded makeshift clubs fashioned from lengths of wood which they used to bludgeon each other as horrified pedestrians looked on. 
The blood-curdling brawl erupted just yards from the Stalingrad Metro station, where a squalid migrant camp has popped up following the demolition of the Jungle. 
It was not immediately clear what sparked the early morning fight, but rival gangs of people smugglers have previously been involved in violent brawls in Calais. 
And despite the horrific brawl, a pro-migrant rally is apparently being organised to take place at the camp at 6pm tonight. 
The once peaceful neighbourhood, in Paris’ 10th Arrondissement, used to be a popular area with tourists, boasting a lively nightlife scene bustling with restaurants and bars. 
But worried residents have revealed how it has become a no go zone in recent weeks following the establishment of the refugee camp, which has brought squalor and violence. 
Thousands of migrants–mostly from Sudan, Libya, Afghanistan, and Eritrea–have pitched tents under the Metro station after the demolition of the Jungle hampered their attempts to reach Britain. 
French police have tried and failed on many occasions to clear the squalid squat, but asylum seekers simply keep on returning and reestablishing it. 
There are now nore than 2,500 migrants pitching up in the makeshift camp, with locals saying the eyesore is ruining their businesses and making life a “living hell”. 
Residents in the once popular district say that the squatters are now becoming increasingly violent and dangerous, with increased reports of muggings. 
Faisal, a shopkeeper, told the French daily Le Figaro that Stalingrad locals are living in fear, threatening the future of his business. 
He said: “The stench of urine, faeces, and rubbish has made Stalingrad an insalubrious place to live. The place is dead – no-one wants to come here anymore. People are afraid to go out and lock themselves in. 
“I’m making less than €60 (£53) a day. A few more weeks like this and I’ll go bust! 
“French people have been kind to them. I know they’re desperate, but the least they can do is respect the law and try and integrate into French society.” 
Jeanne, another Stalingrad resident, told Le Figaro the migrants had become increasingly violent towards locals. 
She said: “Brazen migrants are snatching jewellery and handbags off passers-by–they’re even stealing bread. I’ve seen them beat people up too.” 
Police have raided the camp some 30 times in the past year, and on Monday French president François Hollande vowed to close the camp for good. 
But within 24 hours of a police operation to move migrants on tents had sprung up again, showing the uphill battle authorities in the French capital face to shut down such illegal encampments. 
Furious locals have demanded that the camp be closed once and for all, describing how they have heard “blood-curdling noises” coming from it in the middle of the night. 
Marie, who lives right next to the makeshift camp, told Le Figaro: “Life here has become unbearable. More than 2,500 squatters were evacuated in September, and now, less than two months later, they’re back. And now that the ‘Jungle’ camp has been closed, things are about to get even worse.” 
Another local, Monique, said that she was at “a loss for words” and “utterly distraught” over the situation. 
She said: “The streets are littered with rubbish and faeces. We can hear blood-curdling screams coming from the camp in the middle of the night.","War on the Streets of Paris: Armed Migrants Fight Running Battles in the French Capital War on the Streets of Paris: Armed Migrants Fight Running Battles in the French Capital Nick Gutteridge, Express, November 2, 2016

4638,'There's No Case Here.' Clinton Defiant amid Email Probe,"The race for the White House has become even more uncertain as federal investigators begin searching through newly discovered emails belonging to Hillary Clinton's top aide, Huma Abedin.

The emails were found on a laptop of Abedin's estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, who is currently under investigation for allegedly sexting an underage girl.

Officials have obtained a warrant to search those emails, but it is unlikely the review will be completed by Election Day.

Meanwhile, the presidential race has tightened dramatically in the last several days.

The gap was closing even before Friday's news that the FBI would reopen the investigation into Clinton's emails, but now the contest is virtually a dead heat.

Even though the polls are close, Clinton still has an apparent advantage in the Electoral College. Consequently, both candidates are hitting key swing states where the election will likely be decided.

Addressing supporters at a rally in Kent, Ohio, Monday, the former secretary of state sounded defiant about the email controversy.

""I'm sure a lot of you may be asking what this new email story is about and why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election with no evidence of wrongdoing with just days to go? That's a good question,"" Clinton said.

""First of all, for those of you who are concerned about my use of personal email, I understand. As I said, I'm not making excuses, I understand and I regret it,"" she continued. ""They should look at them. And I'm sure they will reach the same conclusion they did when they looked at my emails for the last year. There is no case here.""

Meanwhile, campaigning in Michigan, Republican rival Donald Trump kept his focus on Clinton's latest controversy.

""Thank you, Anthony. I never liked you, Anthony, but thank you very much,"" the GOP nominee said. ""The Clinton crime spree ends on Nov. 8. It's gonna end on Nov. 8.""

Clinton could face more problems in the days ahead. WikiLeaks is reportedly set to release more hacked emails related to the presidential campaign.

The organization has already caused another problem for Democratic operatives.

CNN dropped former analyst Donna Brazile after WikiLeaks revealed she had leaked a question from one of the debates in the Democratic primary to the Clinton campaign.

No one knows what effect the FBI investigation or the WikiLeaks releases will have before Election Day. The last week before the election could be as unpredictable as the entire campaign has been so far this year.","'There's No Case Here.'

5094,Donald Trump’s RNC 2016 Speech Packed With Lies And Shady Stats,"In Trump’s America, murder is out of control, terror reigns, our enemies are ascendant and our leaders are spineless puppets.

Donald Trump’s speech accepting the Republican nomination at his party's convention Thursday night lasted 75 minutes—the longest since at least 1972—as he painted a grim picture of midnight in America, a country beaten down and besieged by terror, crime, murderous immigrants and smarter adversaries across the globe thanks to foolish and feckless leaders here. 



“At our convention, there will be no lies,” Trump said at the very beginning of his remarks, in which he elaborated on a draft a Republican source leaked to a super-PAC backing Hillary Clinton hours before he spoke. “We will honor the American people with the truth and nothing else.”

“Our convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation,” Trump said in a speech that returned to common themes of law and order and national security, and charges that President Obama and Hillary Clinton had made America and the world less safe. “The attacks on our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.”

But the bleak picture he painted often did not line up with the facts, using over-inflated statistics and questionable generalizations when discussing matters of crime, justice, immigration, and national security.

Trump said that homicides increased by 17 percent from last year in the country’s 50 largest cities. He did not say, however, that the national homicide rate hit a four-decade low last year, according to the FBI—or that the number of people murdered in the 50 largest cities has declined by half since 1991.

In an interview on CNN ahead of the speech, Trump’s campaign chairman Paul Manafort defended the remarks by casting doubt on the FBI’s official crime numbers, which include information gleaned from local police departments.

“The FBI is certainly suspect these days after what they just did with Hillary Clinton,” Manafort said, referring to FBI Director James Comey’s decision to not recommend charges against Clinton over her use of a private email server. “But as far as crime in the neighborhoods, people don’t feel safe.”

According to Politifact, Trump’s often-repeated assertion that there is no vetting system for Syrian refugees is not true. That process can take as long as one year or more, and each refugee is interviewed by officials in the Department of Homeland Security and required to attend cultural classes and pass a medical review.

“I will work with and appoint the best prosecutors and law enforcement officials in the country to get the job done,” Trump declared, while not elaborating on how he would do so. “In this race for the White House, I am the law-and-order candidate.”

In light of the recent shootings of police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge, Trump claimed that the number of officers killed in the line of duty has increased by almost 50 percent year-to-year. The National Law Enforcement Memorial Fund says the number has gone up only slightly—from 62 officers through July 20 of last year to 67 killed so far this year.

Turning to the world—and Clinton—Trump said the U.S. should discontinue its policy of “nation building and regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq, Libya, Egypt and Syria.” But Trump supported the Libya intervention in 2011, saying at the time: “At this point, if you don’t get rid of Gaddafi, it’s a major, major black eye for this country.”

Trump’s dubious contentions were not limited to law and order issues. The billionaire businessman claimed 14 million people “left the workplace entirely.” For context, the current workforce has 4.6 million more people than in 2009. He criticized Obama on the national debt, claiming it doubled. It has actually increased from $11.1 trillion to $19.2 trillion.

Trump also suggested that Clinton is responsible for the creation of ISIS in the Middle East—even though the group did not formally split from al Qaeda until after she left office. He suggested that sanctions on Iran decreased during her tenure in government; in fact, they increased.","Donald Trump’s RNC 2016 Speech Packed With Lies And Shady Stats In Trump’s America, murder is out of control, terror reigns, our enemies are ascendant and our leaders are spineless puppets.

3223,Live from New Hampshire: They’re all here,"This story has been updated.

A stampede of GOP presidential hopefuls descended on New Hampshire this weekend for the First in the Nation Republican Leadership Summit, a political cattle-call that formally kicks off the 2016 presidential primary in the early-voting state.

The Post's Bob Costa explained the stakes in Nashua: ""The attendance by a bevy of ambitious Republicans underscores the intense competition already underway in New Hampshire, which plays a critical role in the nominating process. With no clear front-runner here, campaigns are rushing to make inroads with primary voters who traditionally demand personal interaction and unceasing attention.""

We'll be following the speeches throughout the weekend. Tune in for highlights...

Among the GOP presidential hopefuls who spoke at the leadership summit in New Hampshire on Saturday were former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, businessman Donald Trump, Sen. Lindsey Graham (S.C.), former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.).

Fiorina drew rousing applause when she was asked by a questioner how she would be different from other Republicans, such as Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Scott Walker.

""I am different from everyone else running in every aspect,"" she said, noting her business background made her stand out from people whose only experience has been politics. ""I come at problem solving differently. And oh, by the way, I look a little different, too.""

Jindal spoke at length about his parents who left India and settled in Baton Rouge. He praised their work ethic, the value they placed on education, and their belief in America as the land of unlimited opportunity.

He drew the biggest applause when he said: ""When my parents came to America, they were coming to become Americans. I am tired of the hyphenated Americans. They didn't come to become Indian-Americans.""

Trump was asked what kinds of people he would choose for a Cabinet if he ran for president and won. He criticized the way ambassadors are chosen, singling out Caroline Kennedy, who is U.S. envoy to Japan. ""She is not talented at what you have to do,"" he said. ""She doesn't know anything about trade."" Instead, he would choose someone from Wall Street for that position.

Huckabee was asked to state his opinion on global climate change. ""Fact or fiction?"" the questioner wanted to know. Huckabee said he was in college when scientists were predicting that ""we would all freeze to death."" Now the grim outlook is that the earth will burn up.

""The Earth is an amazing body. Let me be very blunt. I believe the Earth is the Lord's creation,"" he said, as the audience applauded.

Cruz criticized President Obama's efforts to fight the Islamic State. His first question was what he would do differently if he were in the White House. Cruz said the goal shouldn't be to weaken or degrade the terrorist group, but to ""utterly and completely destory ISIS.""

And the current debate over ""boots on the ground"" in Iraq should be driven by military assessments on how to reach that goal, he added. Still, Cruz recalled that he wasn't satisfied with the assessment he heard during a Senate briefing from Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, about how that goal could be achieved.

""I asked him, 'in what time frame can we destroy ISIS,'"" Cruz said. Dempsey responded that there is no military solution, Cruz recalled, only a change in the underlying conditions to prevent potential recruits from being radicalized through poverty.

""There is a word for that--I have to clean it up for C-span--and simply say it's nonense,"" Cruz said. ""The way to defeat ISIS is not expanded Medicaid throughout Iraq.""

Here are some of Friday's speakers:

Best applause line: ""We lived through Jimmy Carter, we'll live through Barack Obama! I promise you!""

Runner-up: ""[Obama] had a very important mission: raising money for needy Democrats in Dallas.""

Hillary hit: “She’s the one that literally brought the reset button to the Kremlin. ... Well [Russia] did reset us, that’s for sure; they reset us back to pre-1989, from my perspective.”

Granite State pander: On what he learned from the last election: ""Number one is you've gotta spend a lot of time in New Hampshire. You better be healthy and you've gotta spend years here.”

How it played: The Texas governor spent a considerable amount of time on foreign policy, showing his grasp of the subject matter while avoiding any ""oops"" moments. (He told audience members running for president takes a lot of work, and that he's been studying up.) Perry received several standing ovations but -- though he delivered an animated speech -- the tone in the room was somewhat subdued.

Best applause line: ""Some people say I'm too blunt and too direct and too straightforward. I think we could use a little bit of that in Washington, D.C.""

Crowd pleaser: “I don’t know what they’re talking about in terms of rough edges. … I’m a Republican in New Jersey. Come and try that for a couple of days. ... [It's] not a place where Republicans go to win elections.""

Obama zinger: ""All he cares about now are his legacy and his library.""

GOP side-eye: ""What amazing leadership I just showed by saying I oppose government waste. ... Anybody that comes up here and says that, boo them off the stage.""

How it played: Christie played to his strengths and only delivered a few minutes of prepared remarks (on entitlement reform), instead choosing to spend most of his time taking questions. The crowd greeted that very warmly. Throughout his speech he urged members of the audience to ask other candidates -- and potential candidates -- what they will do about the cost of entitlement programs: ""If they're not going to do anything to fix that problem, we're not going to be able to deal with any of the other problems...we have in this country.""

Voter buzz: Leader of the pack but needs to prove himself to conservative base*

Subtle Rubio jab: ""We have elected a president who was a phenomenal speaker but he was two years as a United States senator and had no record of accomplishment...and what did we get?""

Obama slam: ""This is the first president in post-World War II era who does not believe that America's presence in the world as a leader and America's power is a force for good. I do.""

Most self-aware line: ""I don't see any coronation coming my way, trust me. We have 95 people running, I'm clearly intimidating a whole bunch of folks, aren't I?""

Kumbaya: ""It's not that [Democrats'] motives are bad, it's just that they have bad ideas. That's the attitude you start with ... you have to rebuild trust. This is where the president has let us down more than any other thing ... it's pushing down people that disagree with him to make himself look better. The next president has to reverse that.""



How it played: Bush spent the first 15 minutes sharing his biography peppered with policy over red meat for the base. Bush is clearly positioning himself for the field's adult-in-the-room role: that of a pragmatic problem-solver who is not driven by ideology. He tried to strike a positive tone about America's future, at one point responding to a question about gay marriage with an answer about restoring economic opportunity for all Americans. It underscored that he wants his campaign to be a debate about economic issues, not cultural/social ones.

Hillary Clinton jab: ""Scott Brown tonight let me know that Hillary Clinton's gonna raise $2.5 billion dollars. That's a lot of Chipotle, my friends.""

Harry Reid jab: “I think I get along personally with everyone, even people that call me a loser.""

Granite State name-check: On the way here, I was texting with my youngest daughter. And I meant to say I'm in Nashua. But I guess the spell check changed it to Nassau. And so she wrote back: How many delegates does the Bahamas have?""

How it played: Rubio gave what's becoming his standard stump speech: He cast himself as a next-generation leader with a forward-looking vision and argued for a muscular foreign policy.

*Rating is based on three recent New Hampshire polls; an April 15 Public Policy Polling survey; a March 25 Franklin Pierce/Boston Herald survey; and a March 24 Suffolk University poll.

With no clear front-runner here, campaigns are rushing to make inroads with primary voters who traditionally demand personal interaction and unceasing attention.""

We'll be following the speeches throughout the weekend. Tune in for highlights...

Among the GOP presidential hopefuls who spoke at the leadership summit in New Hampshire on Saturday were former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, businessman Donald Trump, Sen. Lindsey Graham (S.C.), former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.).

Fiorina drew rousing applause when she was asked by a questioner how she would be different from other Republicans, such as Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Scott Walker.

""I am different from everyone else running in every aspect,"" she said, noting her business background made her stand out from people whose only experience has been politics. ""I come at problem solving differently. And oh, by the way, I look a little different, too.""

Jindal spoke at length about his parents who left India and settled in Baton Rouge. He praised their work ethic, the value they placed on education, and their belief in America as the land of unlimited opportunity.

He drew the biggest applause when he said: ""When my parents came to America, they were coming to become Americans. I am tired of the hyphenated Americans. They didn't come to become Indian-Americans.""

Trump was asked what kinds of people he would choose for a Cabinet if he ran for president and won. He criticized the way ambassadors are chosen, singling out Caroline Kennedy, who is U.S. envoy to Japan. ""She is not talented at what you have to do,"" he said. ""She doesn't know anything about trade."" Instead, he would choose someone from Wall Street for that position.

Huckabee was asked to state his opinion on global climate change. ""Fact or fiction?"" the questioner wanted to know. Huckabee said he was in college when scientists were predicting that ""we would all freeze to death."" Now the grim outlook is that the earth will burn up.

""The Earth is an amazing body. Let me be very blunt. I believe the Earth is the Lord's creation,"" he said, as the audience applauded.

Cruz criticized President Obama's efforts to fight the Islamic State. His first question was what he would do differently if he were in the White House. Cruz said the goal shouldn't be to weaken or degrade the terrorist group, but to ""utterly and completely destory ISIS.""

And the current debate over ""boots on the ground"" in Iraq should be driven by military assessments on how to reach that goal, he added. Still, Cruz recalled that he wasn't satisfied with the assessment he heard during a Senate briefing from Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, about how that goal could be achieved.

""I asked him, 'in what time frame can we destroy ISIS,'"" Cruz said. Dempsey responded that there is no military solution, Cruz recalled, only a change in the underlying conditions to prevent potential recruits from being radicalized through poverty.

""There is a word for that--I have to clean it up for C-span--and simply say it's nonense,"" Cruz said. ""The way to defeat ISIS is not expanded Medicaid throughout Iraq.""

Here are some of Friday's speakers:

Best applause line: ""We lived through Jimmy Carter, we'll live through Barack Obama! I promise you!""

Runner-up: ""[Obama] had a very important mission: raising money for needy Democrats in Dallas.""

Hillary hit: “She’s the one that literally brought the reset button to the Kremlin. ... Well [Russia] did reset us, that’s for sure; they reset us back to pre-1989, from my perspective.”

Granite State pander: On what he learned from the last election: ""Number one is you've gotta spend a lot of time in New Hampshire. You better be healthy and you've gotta spend years here.”

How it played: The Texas governor spent a considerable amount of time on foreign policy, showing his grasp of the subject matter while avoiding any ""oops"" moments. (He told audience members running for president takes a lot of work, and that he's been studying up.) Perry received several standing ovations but -- though he delivered an animated speech -- the tone in the room was somewhat subdued.

Best applause line: ""Some people say I'm too blunt and too direct and too straightforward. I think we could use a little bit of that in Washington, D.C.""

Crowd pleaser: “I don’t know what they’re talking about in terms of rough edges. … I’m a Republican in New Jersey. Come and try that for a couple of days. ... [It's] not a place where Republicans go to win elections.""

Obama zinger: ""All he cares about now are his legacy and his library.""

GOP side-eye: ""What amazing leadership I just showed by saying I oppose government waste. ... Anybody that comes up here and says that, boo them off the stage.""

How it played: Christie played to his strengths and only delivered a few minutes of prepared remarks (on entitlement reform), instead choosing to spend most of his time taking questions. The crowd greeted that very warmly. Throughout his speech he urged members of the audience to ask other candidates -- and potential candidates -- what they will do about the cost of entitlement programs: ""If they're not going to do anything to fix that problem, we're not going to be able to deal with any of the other problems...we have in this country.""

Voter buzz: Leader of the pack but needs to prove himself to conservative base*

Subtle Rubio jab: ""We have elected a president who was a phenomenal speaker but he was two years as a United States senator and had no record of accomplishment...and what did we get?""

Obama slam: ""This is the first president in post-World War II era who does not believe that America's presence in the world as a leader and America's power is a force for good. I do.""

Most self-aware line: ""I don't see any coronation coming my way, trust me. We have 95 people running, I'm clearly intimidating a whole bunch of folks, aren't I?""

Kumbaya: ""It's not that [Democrats'] motives are bad, it's just that they have bad ideas. That's the attitude you start with ... you have to rebuild trust. This is where the president has let us down more than any other thing ... it's pushing down people that disagree with him to make himself look better. The next president has to reverse that.""



How it played: Bush spent the first 15 minutes sharing his biography peppered with policy over red meat for the base. Bush is clearly positioning himself for the field's adult-in-the-room role: that of a pragmatic problem-solver who is not driven by ideology. He tried to strike a positive tone about America's future, at one point responding to a question about gay marriage with an answer about restoring economic opportunity for all Americans. It underscored that he wants his campaign to be a debate about economic issues, not cultural/social ones.

Hillary Clinton jab: ""Scott Brown tonight let me know that Hillary Clinton's gonna raise $2.5 billion dollars. That's a lot of Chipotle, my friends.""

Harry Reid jab: “I think I get along personally with everyone, even people that call me a loser.""

Granite State name-check: On the way here, I was texting with my youngest daughter. And I meant to say I'm in Nashua. But I guess the spell check changed it to Nassau. And so she wrote back: How many delegates does the Bahamas have?""

How it played: Rubio gave what's becoming his standard stump speech: He cast himself as a next-generation leader with a forward-looking vision and argued for a muscular foreign policy.

*Rating is based on three recent New Hampshire polls; an April 15 Public Policy Polling survey; a March 25 Franklin Pierce/Boston Herald survey; and a March 24 Suffolk University poll.

3049,The Supreme Court is just as polarized as the rest of US politics – and this may have profound implications.,"Recent years have seen concerns about political polarization in America come to the fore – one only has to look at the recent fight between Congressional Republicans over the next Speaker of the House or Representatives to witness its effects. But what of judicial polarization? In new research which examines polarization in the US Supreme Court since 1938, Donald Gooch finds that this polarization has also increased, and correlates with congressional and presidential polarization. He argues that this trend is fed by shifts in ideological polarization in the Senate, and in public opinion. If it continues, he writes, polarization may lead to more frequent and powerful attacks on the Supreme Court’s authority and supremacy.

Scholars have long warned of a growing political schism in the American body politic.  Popularized by “Red vs. Blue” maps in national elections, political polarization is defined as a widening divide between partisan identifiers and ideologues in the public and political elite.  Political polarization is one of the most important recent developments in American politics. Concerns about political polarization in American politics focus on its potential to frustrate political accommodation, stymie political actors, clog political processes, disrupt political institutional environments and, in the extreme, spur violent social unrest.  For example, the congressional polarization that emerged in the 1970s has only intensified over time. Polarization has led to greater gridlock, greater partisan rancor between the parties, and greater intraparty cohesion in congressional politics.

The majority of institutional polarization studies emphasize Congress. Judicial polarization, in contrast, is underexplored as an aspect of political polarization and as a determinant of judicial behavior. By examining individual justice polarization and ideological extremity over full tenures on the United States Supreme Court since 1938 and how Court polarization responds to polarization in coordinate institutions over the same time period, I find: strong evidence of increasing Court polarization and that Court polarization correlates with congressional and presidential polarization since the 1950s.  Court polarization is a real and significant political phenomenon in America.

Figure 1 shows the normalized polarization trends in the Court’s institutional environment across the regimes of Chief Justices.   It depicts polarization trends for the Supreme Court, the Senate (standard deviation of senator ideology per congressional term), and the President vis-à-vis the Senate chamber median (absolute difference between President’s ideology score and the median Senator’s ideology score).   Notice the strong apparent linear trend over time in the polarization of all three institutions, interrupted only by the drop in polarization observed between the Senate chamber median and the President during the Vinson regime. The strength of the correlation between the President-Senate chamber median difference and that of Court polarization over the regimes is striking.  A remarkable consistency exists in the peaks and valleys of Court polarization and the ideological distance between the President and the Senate chamber median across chief justice regimes from Hughes to Roberts.

Figure 1 – Polarization Trends in Senate, President-Senate, and Court Polarization (JCS) across Chief Justice Regimes

What is the most parsimonious explanation for these results? An increasingly polarized Senate, through its advice-and-consent role, has produced a mirror image of itself on the Court.  Court and Senate polarization may, in turn, be a function of polarization in the American electorate. Thus, even though the Court is somewhat insulated from democratic forces, the Court is subject to macro-polarization trends (directly and indirectly) through the institutional context.  The Court is responsive to the polarization of entrepreneurial interest groups, such as the Federalist Society (conservative) and the Coalition for a Fair and Independent Judiciary (liberal).

Justices evolve ideologically over time.  The evidence on Court polarization suggests that ideological movement on the Court tends to be in one direction—justices tend to become more liberal the longer they are on the Court. Consider two examples: Harry Blackmun and Clarence Thomas In 1970, Harry Blackmun served his first term on the Court.  At the time, only Chief Justice Burger was more conservative than Blackmun.  In his tenth term on the Court, Justice Blackmun crossed the ideological Rubicon, joining the Court’s left-leaning justices (Figure 2).  By his final term in 1993, Justice Blackmun was as far to the Court’s ideological left as he had been to the Court’s ideological right when he began his career. As a second example, Justice Clarence Thomas, is widely considered to be a stalwart of conservatism on the Court. He holds the extreme rightward location in the judicial common space.  Even Justice Thomas, however, has evolved ideologically over his career.  Unlike Blackmun, Thomas has moved further to the right.  Justice Thomas’s absolute ideological evolution is only half that of Blackmun’s, but Thomas has become nearly twice as conservative as he was when he first joined the Court.

Figure 2 – Career Trends in JCS scores for Justice Thomas and Justice Blackmun

What explains this ideological drift? These ideological sojourns are not made in a vacuum.  Just as Court polarization is a function of the Court’s internal and external environments, individual justices are buffeted by internal and external factors during their judicial decision-making.  Justices are part of the Brethren, a small clique of specialized judicial actors. Thus, they may be influenced by the strategic internal judicial environment and interpersonal justice relationships.  The Court exists in a unique and competitive institutional context. This context constrains judicial behavior. Justices are responsive to mass and elite public opinion. There is strong evidence justices evolve ideologically on the Court in response to shifts in the ideological polarization in the Senate. Other external factors create leftward headwinds.  The Court is responsive to legal elites and legal institutions shaping the debate over judicial policy.  Institutions like the American Bar Association reflect the liberal tilt among legal professionals; these institutions help establish a range of judicial policies acceptable to the leftward shifted legal elite. Favorable press coverage of justices becoming more liberal, the so-called “Greenhouse Effect,” may induce more justices to evolve in the left ideological direction.  Within, justices may serve as ideological lodestones, drawing fellow justices to their own ideological viewpoint. My analysis suggests that this movement is not merely a function of drift, but rather the consequence of the political environment within which the Court makes policy.  Elite polarization entrepreneurs, public opinion shaped by media coverage, and institutional constraints may all play a part in causing justices to move to the Left over their careers.

What are the implications of this analysis? Court polarization and polarization in the Court’s strategic environment influence justice ideological disposition and evolution. These two types of Court polarization may have wide-ranging effects on: the judicial nomination process, the Senate judicial confirmation process, and, subsequently, the policy output of the Court.   Ideological polarization influences competition between the branches over policy.  Justices becoming more liberal over time influences policy debates concerning the life-tenure of justices. It could change how presidents, particularly Republican presidents, choose nominees for the Court.  The emergent ideological polarization on the Court has profound implications for how the Court will figure in the national political discourse and how its interactions with polarization forces will affect the constitutional order.  A polarized Court is more vulnerable to the attacks of reconstructive presidents.  Presidents may take advantage of Court polarization to politicize Court decisions in a bid to detract from the Court’s constitutional authority and to challenge judicial supremacy.

Polarization bodes ill for the prospects of consensus among the branches on constitutional meaning.  President Obama’s 2010 State of the Union challenge to the Supreme Court over Citizens United and Justice Alito’s “not true” rejoinder is illustrative of the Court-president conflict that polarization may engender.  Polarization may lead to more frequent and more powerful attacks on judicial authority and judicial supremacy. These implications make it clear that judicial polarization is an important phenomenon of the U.S. Supreme Court and a topic ripe for further study.

 Donald M. Gooch is an Assistant Professor of Political Science in the Department of Government at Stephen F. Austin State University. His research agenda includes political polarization, behavior on the Supreme Court, campaign finance regulation, civic education, formal theory and the spatial theory of voting.","The Supreme Court is just as polarized as the rest of US politics – and this may have profound implications. Recent years have seen concerns about political polarization in America come to the fore – one only has to look at the recent fight between Congressional Republicans over the next Speaker of the House or Representatives to witness its effects. But what of judicial polarization? In new research which examines polarization in the US Supreme Court since 1938, Donald Gooch finds that this polarization has also increased, and correlates with congressional and presidential polarization. He argues that this trend is fed by shifts in ideological polarization in the Senate, and in public opinion. If it continues, he writes, polarization may lead to more frequent and powerful attacks on the Supreme Court’s authority and supremacy.

9536,BREAKING: Putin Issues Massive Warning to the West,"Russia unveiled a weapon capable of reaching United States territory recently, and on its heels, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the actions undertaken in Washington are “pushing Russia into a nuclear arms race,” according to Zero Hedge . 
Zero Hedge reported: 
Yesterday, Russia reveals photos of a new highly advanced liquid fuelled heavy ICBM capable of evading anti-missile defences and hitting US territory with 10 tonne nuclear payload. 
The Makeyev Design Bureau – the designer of Russia’s heavy liquid fuelled Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (“ICBMs”) – ie. of missiles capable of reaching US territory from Russian territory, has published the first picture of Russia’s new heavy Sarmat ICBM which is due to enter service shortly, probably in 2018. 
The Makeyev Design Bureau also released this statement along with the picture of the Sarmat ICBM: “In accordance with the Decree of the Russian Government ‘On the State Defence Order for 2010 and the planning period 2012-2013,’ the Makeyev Rocket Design Bureau was instructed to start design and development work on the Sarmat. In June 2011, the Bureau and the Russian Ministry of Defense signed a state contract for the Sarmat’s development. The prospective strategic missile system is being developed in order to assuredly and effectively fulfil objectives of nuclear deterrent by Russia’s strategic forces.” 
As Zero Hedge noted, the Sarmat has a specific goal of evading U.S. anti-ballistic missile systems that have been deployed in Eastern Europe. 
This is yet another reason why we need a president who understands the importance of modernizing and beefing up our military in these uncertain times. 
While the U.S. stays stuck in the 1960’s and 1970’s with our strategic deterrents, Russia is working to upgrade their armory. The new Sarmat missile is set to be ready to go in 2018. 
AntiWar’s Jason Ditz had this to say about the situation between the U.S. and Russia in regard to our respective military capabilities: 
Of course, the United States spends many, many times what Russia does on its military, but the fact that Russia has a proper military capable of defending the nation at all puts it in a total different category from most of America’s recent wars, and Russia’s massive nuclear arsenal makes it clear this is one war which, if the US launches it, they won’t be able to win outright. 
Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has called for a no-fly zone over Syria. Here’s what Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph Dunford, had to say about that. 
“Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria it would require us to go to war, against Syria and Russia,” he said. “That’s a pretty fundamental decision that certainly I’m not going to make.” 
Clinton’s track record — both in action and in words — proves that she does not have the judgment necessary to be president.","BREAKING: Putin Issues Massive Warning to the West Russia unveiled a weapon capable of reaching United States territory recently, and on its heels, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the actions undertaken in Washington are “pushing Russia into a nuclear arms race,” according to Zero Hedge .

8901,Dennis Kucinich’s Extraordinary Warning on D.C.’s Think Tank Warmongers,"Thursday Oct 27, 2016 
WAR is a racket. It always has been. 
It is possibly the oldest, easily the most profitable, surely the most vicious. It is the only one international in scope. It is the only one in which the profits are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives. 
A racket is best described, I believe, as something that is not what it seems to the majority of the people. Only a small “inside” group knows what it is about. It is conducted for the benefit of the very few, at the expense of the very many. Out of war a few people make huge fortunes. 
– From Major General Smedley Butler’s War is a Rackett 
Former Congressman Dennis Kucinich has just penned an extremely powerful warning about the warmongers in Washington D.C. Who funds them, what their motives are, and why it is imperative for the American people to stop them. 
The piece was published at The Nation and is titled: Why Is the Foreign Policy Establishment Spoiling for More War? Look at Their Donors . 
Read it and share it with everyone you know. 
W ashington, DC, may be the only place in the world where people openly flaunt their pseudo-intellectuality by banding together, declaring themselves “think tanks,” and raising money from external interests, including foreign governments, to compile reports that advance policies inimical to the real-life concerns of the American people. 
As a former member of the House of Representatives, I remember 16 years of congressional hearings where pedigreed experts came to advocate wars in testimony based on circular, rococo thinking devoid of depth, reality, and truth. I remember other hearings where the Pentagon was unable to reconcile over $1 trillion in accounts, lost track of $12 billion in cash sent to Iraq, and rigged a missile-defense test so that an interceptor could easily home in on a target. War is first and foremost a profitable racket. 
How else to explain that in the past 15 years this city’s so called bipartisan foreign policy elite has promoted wars in Iraq and Libya, and interventions in Syria and Yemen, which have opened Pandora’s box to a trusting world, to the tune of trillions of dollars, a windfall for military contractors. DC’s think “tanks” should rightly be included in the taxonomy of armored war vehicles and not as gathering places for refugees from academia. 
According to the front page of this past Friday’s Washington Post, the bipartisan foreign-policy elite recommends the next president show less restraint than President Obama. Acting at the urging of “liberal” hawks brandishing humanitarian intervention, read war, the Obama administration attacked Libya along with allied powers working through NATO. 
Indeed, I warned about this in last week’s piece: U.S. Foreign Policy ‘Elite’ Eagerly Await an Expansion of Overseas Wars Under Hillary Clinton . 
The think tankers fell in line with the Iraq invasion. Not being in the tank, I did my own analysis of the call for war in October of 2002, based on readily accessible information, and easily concluded that there was no justification for war. I distributed it widely in Congress and led 125 Democrats in voting against the Iraq war resolution. There was no money to be made from a conclusion that war was uncalled for, so, against millions protesting in the United States and worldwide, our government launched into an abyss, with a lot of armchair generals waving combat pennants. The marching band and chowder society of DC think tanks learned nothing from the Iraq and Libya experience. 
The only winners were arms dealers, oil companies, and jihadists. Immediately after the fall of Libya, the black flag of Al Qaeda was raised over a municipal building in Benghazi, Gadhafi’s murder was soon to follow, with Secretary Clinton quipping with a laugh, “We came, we saw, he died.” President Obama apparently learned from this misadventure, but not the Washington policy establishment, which is spoiling for more war. 
The self-identified liberal Center for American Progress (CAP) is now calling for Syria to be bombed, and estimates America’s current military adventures will be tidied up by 2025, a tardy twist on “mission accomplished.” CAP, according to a report in The Nation, has received funding from war contractors Lockheed Martin and Boeing, who make the bombers that CAP wants to rain hellfire on Syria. 
The Brookings Institute has taken tens of millions from foreign governments , notably Qatar, a key player in the military campaign to oust Assad. Retired four-star Marine general John Allen is now a Brookings senior fellow . Charles Lister is a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute , which has received funding from Saudi Arabia , the major financial force providing billions in arms to upend Assad and install a Sunni caliphate stretching across Iraq and Syria. Foreign-government money is driving our foreign policy. 
As the drumbeat for an expanded war gets louder, Allen and Lister jointly signed an op-ed in the Sunday Washington Post, calling for an attack on Syria. The Brookings Institute, in a report to Congress , admitted it received $250,000 from the US Central Command, Centcom, where General Allen shared leadership duties with General David Petraeus. Pentagon money to think tanks that endorse war? This is academic integrity, DC-style. 
And why is Central Command, as well as the Food and Drug Administration, the US Department of transportation, and the US Department of Health and Human Services giving money to Brookings? 
Former secretary of state Madeleine Albright, who famously told Colin Powell , “What’s the point of having this superb military you’re always talking about if we can’t use it,” predictably says of this current moment , “We do think there needs to be more American action.” A former Bush administration top adviser is also calling for the United States to launch a cruise missile attack on Syria. 
The American people are fed up with war, but a concerted effort is being made through fearmongering, propaganda, and lies to prepare our country for a dangerous confrontation, with Russia in Syria. 
The demonization of Russia is a calculated plan to resurrect a raison d’être for stone-cold warriors trying to escape from the dustbin of history by evoking the specter of Russian world domination. 
It’s infectious. Earlier this year the BBC broadcast a fictional show that contemplated WWIII, beginning with a Russian invasion of Latvia (where 26 percent of the population is ethnic Russian and 34 percent of Latvians speak Russian at home). 
The imaginary WWIII scenario conjures Russia’s targeting London for a nuclear strike. No wonder that by the summer of 2016 a poll showed two-thirds of UK citizens approved the new British PM’s launching a nuclear strike in retaliation. So much for learning the lessons detailed in the Chilcot report. 
As this year’s presidential election comes to a conclusion, the Washington ideologues are regurgitating the same bipartisan consensus that has kept America at war since 9/11 and made the world a decidedly more dangerous place. 
The DC think tanks provide cover for the political establishment, a political safety net, with a fictive analytical framework providing a moral rationale for intervention, capitol casuistry. I’m fed up with the DC policy elite who cash in on war while presenting themselves as experts, at the cost of other people’s lives, our national fortune, and the sacred honor of our country. 
Any report advocating war that comes from any alleged think tank ought to be accompanied by a list of the think tank’s sponsors and donors and a statement of the lobbying connections of the report’s authors. 
It is our patriotic duty to expose why the DC foreign-policy establishment and its sponsors have not learned from their failures and instead are repeating them, with the acquiescence of the political class and sleepwalkers with press passes. 
It is also time for a new peace movement in America, one that includes progressives and libertarians alike, both in and out of Congress, to organize on campuses, in cities, and towns across America, to serve as an effective counterbalance to the Demuplican war party, its think tanks, and its media cheerleaders. The work begins now, not after the Inauguration. We must not accept war as inevitable, and those leaders who would lead us in that direction, whether in Congress or the White House, must face visible opposition. 
Thank you Mr. Kucinich, I couldn’t agree more.

Montreat College professor William Forstchen says Election 2016 could lead to another bloody civil war. Professor Forstchen specializes in Civil War history. Forstchen gave warning on the October 25th edition of “The Jim Bakker Show” during their weeklong, “Ready Now Expo Oct. 2016.” Forstchen: “I’m a civil war historian.” The U.S. election of 1860 “is the closest I can parallel this to.” “And we all know what the price was. When we went to a civil war, they killed 660,000 young men because we became so divided.” Forstchen urged voters to turn out even if they disliked the candidates, because of other US congress races and the Supreme Court appointment. Forstchen: “I do believe we are at 1860. We are that close to the edge of the debacle.” Baptist pastor Carl Gallups then alluded to false Christian doctrine: “The prophecy clock started ticking” when the modern nation of Israel was established in 1948. In 1860: Four candidates received substantive amounts of votes in the U.S. presidential election. Abraham Lincoln (39.8 percent), Stephen Douglas (29.5 percent), John Breckinridge (18.1 percent) and John Bell (12.6 percent). On December 20, 1860 (44 days after Republican Lincoln was elected): Delegates to a convention in South Carolina unanimously voted to secede from the United States. Forstchen has co-authored books with Newt Gingrich. 
(WASHINGTON, DC) A professor who specializes in the Civil War appeared on a special edition of “The Jim Bakker Show” last week to warn America that the 2016 presidential election could lead to another secessionist melee. 
“I’m a civil war historian,” the Montreat College professor, William Forstchen , explained by way of introduction. 
The U.S. election of 1860 “is the closest I can parallel this to,” Forstchen said. 
“And we all know what the price was,” the professor then said. “When we went to a civil war, they killed 660,000 young men because we became so divided.” 
Next, Forstchen went on a lengthy diatribe about the U.S. Constitution and the importance of voting. 
He urged “those of you who feel ‘I can’t quite pull the lever for this person or that person'” in the presidential election to vote because U.S. senators and representatives are up for election, and because the Senate must confirm Supreme Court justices. 
Forstchen failed to explain how the results of the 2016 election will hasten — or prevent — a civil war. He also did not specifically mention or endorse any candidates for office. 
Nevertheless, the professor concluded with an adamant exhortation that a civil war is nigh. 
“I do believe we are at 1860,” Forstchen said, looking directly into the camera. “We are that close to the edge of the debacle.” 
From there, another guest, Baptist pastor Carl Gallups, declared that “the prophecy clock started ticking” when the modern nation of Israel was established in 1948. 
Gallups, who introduced Donald Trump at a Donald Trump rally in January 2016, is famous because he has used his radio show to give a platform to people who deny the reality of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, according to the Connecticut Post http://www.ctpost.com/local/article/Trump-disavows-Sandy-Hook-truther-who-6880064.php. Gallups has also said he believes neither Marco Rubio nor Ted Cruz are eligible to be president because of the circumstances of their births. 
The segment featuring Forstchen and Gallups was part of The Jim Bakker Show’s weeklong “Ready Now Expo Oct. 2016”— featuring several survival products. 
Four candidates received any substantive amount of votes in the U.S. presidential election in 1860: Abraham Lincoln (39.8 percent), Stephen Douglas (29.5 percent), John Breckinridge (18.1 percent) and John Bell (12.6 percent). 
On December 20, 1860, delegates to a convention in South Carolina unanimously voted to secede from the United States — 44 days after Lincoln, a Republican, was elected. 
Montreat College, Forstchen’s employer, is a small Christian liberal arts college with a main campus located in rural North Carolina. 
Forstchen has written a couple dozen novels and several short stories. His co-author for some of the books is Newt Gingrich.

6126,WikiLeaks: Look Who The Clinton Camp Most Wants to Please,"Pinterest 
Who does the Clinton camp want to make “happy”? Not the American people, of course, but none other than billionaire left-wing globalist George Soros. 
Soros has donated around $25 million to the Clinton campaign as of July, according to Politico , and that clearly buys a great deal of influence. WikiLeaks has recently released emails from the account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta that show the lengths the campaign went to keep Soros “happy” and the huge amount of influence he exerted. 
In an Oct. 7, 2014 email from top Clinton aide Huma Abedin to now-campaign manager Robby Mook, Abedin discussed a dinner Clinton was going to have with Soros. Abedin said in the email that she expected that Soros would eventually ask Clinton to attend a fundraiser for one of the numerous groups Soros helps bankroll, the liberal America Votes organization. 
Mook replied to the email: “I would only do this for political reasons (ie to make Soros happy).” 
Fox News reported : 
During her time as secretary of state, Clinton was forwarded from Soros’ aides on Jan. 23, 2011 a message he wrote specifically for her addressing “a serious situation” in Albania. Soros even included two actions that “need to be done urgently.” One of the suggestions was appointing “a mediator such as Carl Bildt, Martti Ahtisaari or Miroslav Lajcak…” 
Clinton received the email the next day. On Jan. 27, Lajcak met Albanian leaders for a mediation effort. 
In another instance, just hours after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia on Feb. 13, 2016, Chris Stone, president of the Soros-founded Open Society Foundations, emailed Podesta and asked: “Remember our discussion of Wallace Jefferson, [former] Chief Justice in Texas?” Podesta simply replied, “yup.” 
An adviser and spokesman for Soros, Michael Vachon, did most of the corresponding with Podesta related to Soros. Vachon scheduled phone calls and meetings along with making sure that the campaign knew Soros’ position on a variety of policy issues. 
Fox News reported: 
On March 7, 2016, Vachon sent Podesta a memo regarding “TPP and Malaysia’s Corruption Crisis.” The document criticized President Obama for making “visible compromises” in his quest to get a deal for the Trans Pacific Partnership completed. Podesta was ostensibly set to discuss the memo with Soros and his son, Alexander, during a dinner later that month. Six days later, Vachon got even more specific. 
“In general I think George is more interested in talking about policy than the campaign per se,” Vachon wrote. “In a separate email I will send you George’s latest thinking on the migration crisis, which he is spending a lot of time on. His other big preoccupation these days is Ukraine.” 
Refugees/migration, the Supreme Court, global warming, Ukraine, etc., are surely just a sampling of policy issues on which the globalist Soros has and will continue to influence Clinton. 
Clinton is dangerous enough as it is, but as the man who could be directing policy decisions if Clinton is elected president? That is a scary thought.","WikiLeaks: Look Who The Clinton Camp Most Wants to Please Pinterest

8063,Welcome to the Trump World Order      : Information," Welcome to the Trump World Order By Maria Dubovikova
 So Donald Trump is the new president of the United States. Allan Lichtman and his 13 Keys to the White House have been proved right. The 30-year tradition of predicting the out-come of the US presidential elections continues uninterrupted. Political figures have started checking their social media accounts, deleting Tweets that could be uncomplimentary to Trump. It doesnt help as the Internet remembers everything.
Some are even more unlucky. French President Francois Hollande said in public recently that Trump make you want to retch. The global political narrative is quickly drifting away from the dumb Trump to Congratulations, dear Mr. President, I always knew you would win!
Journalists who had been vilifying Trump  and promising apocalypse in case he is elected  have started debating how he would possibly save the world. Most experts failed in their prognosis. They could not imagine that the erratic Trump will be victorious over reserved, pragmatic, and experienced Clinton. They had their reasons but in their analysis they missed a lot of things.
Why Trump is president-elect Trump is a living example of the American dream. From being a simple middle class Ameri-can, child of second generation German immigrants, he jumped to become a billionaire and then the US president. His penthouse apartment is said to be more luxurious than the White House. He had his own plane before becoming the US president.
More importantly, he has promised to revive the American dream for all Americans, irrespec-tive of their social status. Experts and the so-called elite considered his mannerisms and choice of language as a disadvantage. But instead it turned out to be his advantage as he connected to people in their language.
The fact remains that the elite, and people considering themselves intellectuals, do not form the majority in any society. The US is no different. Trumps tweets and declarations were shocking for the elites but were very common for the masses. His imperfections made him closer to the ordinary people, especially from the working class. The he is one of us image always works when you deal with the masses. He gambled with it and emerged the winner.
He got a chance to grab the Oval Cabinet as he is not liberal. Shadi Hamid seems right not believing that humans naturally inclined toward liberalism. Moreover, some men continue to remain sexist. If they dont confess it, they keep this deep inside. Women frequently like more bad guys than respectable family men. They may not confess it but this sometimes reveals where their sympathies lie and how they vote.
A large number of white Americans continue to show racist tendencies. While calls for toler-ance goes on, the influx of immigrants gave a fertile ground for racism and somehow xeno-phobia. During these elections, it appeared, that the Americans had to choose between two candi-dates with little credibility. They opted for change and fresh ideas. Also, the turnout was far lesser than on the previous elections, which indicates disillusionment over the current presi-dential campaign and both the candidates.
Popular vote shows the deep divide in the American society, with Clinton showing ad-vantage over Trump. However, it was the US electoral system that brought Trump to power.
Homeland and foreign policy Apparently he is set to make America great again not by foreign policy and imposing its will but by boosting the economy, retuning to manufacturing and giving new jobs. There is also a possibility that he will put even foreign policy based on business ties. So no help or assis-tance could come for free or without concomitant advantages for the economy.
The tycoon that he has been Trump is aware that money decides everything. He will proba-bly try to implement this rule in policymaking, both at home and abroad. The main motive of the foreign policy could turn into bargain, trading and profit.
Trump is not going to be easy for the Arab leaders. You, guys, are out of business  these were his words in response to a journalist asking about the President-elects policy vision toward the Middle East. Pro-Israeli and mostly anti-Arab, he will not try to solve Arab prob-lems anymore. However, he will continue the US fight against terrorism and probably be more hawkish than Clinton.
In any case, he will not be inclined to treat the Arabs as equal partners. Such an attitude is going to be unacceptable for the Middle Easters powers and could lead to cooling of ties. The same fate  i.e. no allies, just business  probably awaits Europe.
Trump and Russia Russia, which was frequently debated during the campaign, is neither a winner nor a looser after this election. First of all, no one really knows who is Mr. Trump and what he is going to do. Secondly, he has Senate and Congress, which will not let him do whatever he likes. Moreover, an anti-Russian spirit prevails in the US no matter what.
With Senate and the Congress, both in Republican hands, they are likely to seriously limit his intentions, as he will have to balance between what he wants and what he actually can. However, this man is hard to deal with. So pressure groups and other instruments of man-agement of the US policy will not probably work with Trump.
Even if there is a shift in the US-Russia relations, this will take a long time. Such a shift is needed anyway and a confrontation isnt good for the whole world. Trump is probably de-fined to press the reboot button in Russian relations and Russia doesnt need a weak US. Russia needs to speak with the US, to listen and to be heard. Trump, as a businessman, seems exactly that kind of a figure.
We are entering into a new era that will be hardly predictable but extremely interesting. Clinton had many cards on her hands but failed to play them the right way. Trump has out-smarted her. A game of poker has never been so relevant as an analogy. A spicy 45th season of the United States Saga is about to begin.

 So Donald Trump is the new president of the United States. Allan Lichtman and his 13 Keys to the White House have been proved right. The 30-year tradition of predicting the out-come of the US presidential elections continues uninterrupted. Political figures have started checking their social media accounts, deleting Tweets that could be uncomplimentary to Trump. It doesnt help as the Internet remembers everything.
Some are even more unlucky. French President Francois Hollande said in public recently that Trump make you want to retch. The global political narrative is quickly drifting away from the dumb Trump to Congratulations, dear Mr. President, I always knew you would win!
Journalists who had been vilifying Trump  and promising apocalypse in case he is elected  have started debating how he would possibly save the world. Most experts failed in their prognosis. They could not imagine that the erratic Trump will be victorious over reserved, pragmatic, and experienced Clinton. They had their reasons but in their analysis they missed a lot of things.
Why Trump is president-elect Trump is a living example of the American dream. From being a simple middle class Ameri-can, child of second generation German immigrants, he jumped to become a billionaire and then the US president. His penthouse apartment is said to be more luxurious than the White House. He had his own plane before becoming the US president.
More importantly, he has promised to revive the American dream for all Americans, irrespec-tive of their social status. Experts and the so-called elite considered his mannerisms and choice of language as a disadvantage. But instead it turned out to be his advantage as he connected to people in their language.

935,"Will Cruz, Sanders Victories Lead to Contested Conventions?","As expected, the voters of Wisconsin have given both Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., victories over their parties' front-runners.

Did Trump's abortion comments and his attacks on Gov. Scott Walker hurt him in Wisconsin? Click play for CBN News Chief Political Correspondent David Brody's take on Tuesday's primary results.

That means contested party conventions may be more likely this summer for the Republicans and maybe even the Democrats.

It wasn't a knock-out punch, but Cruz delivered a major blow to Donald Trump's effort to secure enough delegates to win the Republican presidential nomination before the GOP convention.

""God bless the great state of Wisconsin!"" Cruz exclaimed Tuesday before a group of his supporters.

Wisconsin Republicans gave him the nod over Trump, 48 percent to 35 percent. Ohio Gov. John Kasich came in a disappointing and distant third, winning only 14 percent of the vote.

Cruz said he is truly unifying the Republican Party.

""Tonight is a turning point,"" he said. ""It is a rallying cry. It is a call from the hard-working men and women of Wisconsin to the people of America. We have a choice. A real choice.""

Meanwhile, Trump responded saying there's no party unity -- just an anti-Trump initiative led by the GOP establishment.

But American voters may now be moving toward favoring Cruz over Trump. A new Reuters poll shows the Texas lawmaker leading Trump for the first time nationally, 39 to 37 percent.

He still needs to win 1,237 delegates to get the nomination. After Wisconsin, Trump has 740 delegates, Cruz has 514 and Kasich only 143.

Meanwhile on the Democratic side, Badger State voters made Hillary Clinton ""feel the Bern.""

Moments after he learned he had defeated Clinton in Wisconsin, Sanders shouted, ""We won in Wisconsin!"" during a campaign rally in Wyoming.

The Vermont Democratic socialist senator decisively beat Clinton by 10 points, with almost 57 percent of the vote to her to 43 percent.

Sanders said he's proving his effort is not just a fringe campaign.

""We have now won seven out of the eight last caucuses and primaries,"" he explained.

But Sanders still needs to win about 67 percent of the remaining delegates to secure the Democratic presidential nomination -- 2,383 are needed. Currently, Clinton has 1,743, while Sanders has 1,056.

While the momentum may now favor Sanders and Cruz, it can quickly change in political campaigns. Both Trump and Clinton are expected to win their home state of New York when voters go to the polls for that primary in two weeks.","Will Cruz, Sanders Victories Lead to Contested Conventions?

Meanwhile, Trump responded saying there's no party unity -- just an anti-Trump initiative led by the GOP establishment.

But American voters may now be moving toward favoring Cruz over Trump. A new Reuters poll shows the Texas lawmaker leading Trump for the first time nationally, 39 to 37 percent.

He still needs to win 1,237 delegates to get the nomination. After Wisconsin, Trump has 740 delegates, Cruz has 514 and Kasich only 143.

Meanwhile on the Democratic side, Badger State voters made Hillary Clinton ""feel the Bern.""

Moments after he learned he had defeated Clinton in Wisconsin, Sanders shouted, ""We won in Wisconsin!"" during a campaign rally in Wyoming.

The Vermont Democratic socialist senator decisively beat Clinton by 10 points, with almost 57 percent of the vote to her to 43 percent.

Sanders said he's proving his effort is not just a fringe campaign.

""We have now won seven out of the eight last caucuses and primaries,"" he explained.

But Sanders still needs to win about 67 percent of the remaining delegates to secure the Democratic presidential nomination -- 2,383 are needed. Currently, Clinton has 1,743, while Sanders has 1,056.

While the momentum may now favor Sanders and Cruz, it can quickly change in political campaigns. Both Trump and Clinton are expected to win their home state of New York when voters go to the polls for that primary in two weeks.","cruz sander victory lead contest convention expect voter wisconsin give sen ted cruz r-texas bernie sander d-vt victory party front-runners.

Press TV Debate , featuring Kevin Barrett , Veterans Today Editor 
The 13th day of the Iranian calendar month of Aban, which falls on November 3, is known as the Student Day in Iran, marking the National Day of Fight against Global Arrogance. On this day 37 years ago, a group of Iranian university students took over the US embassy in Tehran, which had turned into a center of espionage aimed at overthrowing the Islamic Republic following the country’s Islamic Revolution earlier in 1979. 
Press TV has spoken to Kevin Barrett, an author and Middle East expert, as well as Maxine Dovere, a journalist and political commentator, to get their take on this issue. 
Barrett believes the US embassy in Iran was a “CIA station” which was used to “run the country” before the revolution, adding that Iranian students had every right to take it over. 
He also said the United States was using its embassy to essentially “dominate” and “exploit” Iran through the puppet government of the Shah whose “torturers were trained by the CIA.” 
The analyst further stated the US is an “aggressive imperial power” which has been waging wars of “disguised aggression” throughout the world. 
He also opined that the United States is “today’s supreme war criminal” which has been using the word “preemptive war” to legitimize its “naked undisguised aggressions” after the “neoconservative-Zionist coup d’état of September 11, 2001.” 
“The neoconservatives in particular after their coup d’état on September 11, 2001 made it clear that any country in the world that seeks parity with the United States must be destroyed preemptively and that is essentially the situation we have today as the US Empire is out there crushing the Middle East, destroying all of Israel’s enemies through balkanization, through Oded Yinon Plan to break up these countries into smaller units along ethnic and sectarian lines, getting ready for a war with China and provoking a war with Russia through aggressive actions in Ukraine and through the destruction of Syria and threats against Russia when Russia comes to the defense of Syria,” he said. 
Elsewhere in his remarks, Barrett noted that both US presidential candidates are “quite horrific” in their policies toward the Middle East – namely Iran. 
He also asserted that Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei is “absolutely right” in saying that he cannot trust the United States and that Tehran has to “rethink” the opening it has had towards Washington. 
Ayatollah Khamenei has warned that compromise with the United States will not resolve Iran’s problems as Washington has not set aside its hostilities towards the Iranian nation. 
Meanwhile the other panelist on Press TV’s program, Maxine Dovere, mentioned that taking over an embassy is not “an acceptable diplomatic action” anywhere in the world. 
“An embassy is sacred ground for any country in any other country. Having a diplomatic dispute is certainly one of the things that happens in political and diplomatic life but taking over an embassy and holding diplomats hostage is not within the realm of normal political behavior,” she said. 
According to the commentator, the United States and Iran need to come to “a civil understanding” and “a trust,” adding that part of this process is eliminating the shaky foundations that have existed until 2016. 
Elsewhere in her remarks, she dismissed the US election campaign as a “negative personality cult” which has not concentrated on policy, economics, and foreign relations. 
She also said all the important issues that a president eventually has to deal with seem to have gotten lost in this election campaign.

If you’re always making excuses to skip the gym, you’ve got to check this out. 
Let’s be honest: We all can use a little extra push to get the most out of our workouts. Now, there’s one spin studio that has a brand-new approach to take motivation to the next level. At SpinZone NYC, they’ve got a great new twist to keep riders active and focused the whole 45 minutes: Every one of their bikes is hooked up to a sick child’s life support. 
Too cool! Where do we sign up??? 
If you thought spin class was intense before, just wait until you see this setup. With 16 bikes, each hooked up to the equipment needed to keep one child alive, there’s no doubt that every bit of effort counts—if you stop pedaling, the machines stop, too. Even with the array of pulsing lights and music we’ve come to expect from spin class, the distinct sound of an EKG flatlining on a 7-year-old can be a powerful motivator to let riders know it’s time to step things up. 
In an increasingly competitive fitness market, the innovative approach at SpinZone NYC is a breath of fresh air, and it’s winning them new customers left and right. With no backup generators and no excuses, they’ve created exactly the kind of environment people need to get real results. Instructors are always there to offer a word of encouragement and remind cyclists how severe their child’s condition is. And forget about plateauing—once participants make it through a full session with one sick kid, that just means a bigger and sicker child for the next workout. 
“I used to make it 30 minutes, tops,” said Erika Perry, a regular who says she never breaks eye contact with her kid for extra motivation to keep going. “Now I regularly make it the full class. There’s something about a child depending on me for survival that really gets me going in the morning. And I’ve dropped 11 pounds and feel great!” 
Wow, it sounds like things are off to a great start! If this catches on, it’s exactly the kind of bold idea that can transform an entire industry. Way to go, SpinZone NYC.

8962,How To Choose The Best Batteries For Prepper Solar Systems,"Carmela Tyrell November 3, 2016 How To Choose The Best Batteries For Prepper Solar Systems 
No matter what device you use to turn solar power into electricity, a storage system for the electricity is absolutely essential. Without batteries or some other form of storage, you will not be able to produce an even flow of current or span time gaps when the system produces too little power or none at all. 
While there are many different kinds of batteries on the market that can be used with solar systems, they may not be best for preppers. 
Here are some things you should keep in mind when buying pre-fabricated batteries. 
Understand How the Batteries Will Be Used 
If you don’t want to spend a lot of time figuring out your average household electric consumption, simply go back to your electric bills for one year. Pick the highest bill and look at the amount of electricity you used. Multiply that by about 30% to take into account higher energy drains for unusual weather patterns and you will have some good ideas about how much power the batteries will need to produce per year. 
While power output is a very important part of understanding battery use, it is also important to keep the following factors in mind: Aside from computing average yearly and daily use, it is also very important to know how deeply you can cycle the battery, (essentially how much you can let it drain to almost empty before recharging it) and how often you can do so without damage. Even though modern batteries are connected to systems that reduce the risk of overcharging, there is no way to prevent the battery from being cycled too deeply or too often other than to have more batteries in the system. Make sure that the batteries can safely withstand charging and discharging at the same time. Do not just go by the battery type when making this assessment. Rather, look for testimonials and consumer reports on the actual models of interest to you. If you do not feel confident that the battery can truly handle this type of use, then create a system with two battery banks so that one can be used for powering your home while the other is charging back up again. Aside from the amount of power being drawn from the battery, some devices draw it faster than others. When evaluating batteries for a solar system, make sure you know how quickly they can be discharged without causing damage. You may find cheaper batteries that cannot be drained as quickly, however you may have to switch between devices so that you do not ruin the batteries. 
Long Warranties vs. Stockpiling 
Right now, our nation and world are facing some very serious catastrophes. For the first time in decades, we have a candidate for president “playing chicken” with nuclear armed Russia to the point where Putin says war with the United State is inevitable. 
If that isn’t bad enough, we’ve essentially got all four of the Biblical horsemen of the apocalypse in play: Famine (in the form of crop failures caused by floods, bee shortages, and soil depletion) Disease (super bugs on the rise, deadly vaccines that leave us vulnerable to cancer yet allergic to common foods such as peanut butter and dairy, and food borne illness that may be enhanced by “undocumented citizens” that tend to work in food production) Warfare (terrorism aside, civil war might erupt right beneath our own feet) A pervasive sense of some kind of death march that most don’t even recognize because they have been so heavily brainwashed and bound up into a system of lies, corruption, and greed. 
With all of this going on, it is entirely too easy to disregard warranties because the companies that offer them may not be available to meet their end of the bargain once society collapses past a certain point. 
That being said, neither we, nor these companies actually know when a major disaster will come along. It would be foolhardy, at best for a company to give a longer warranty on something that will fail much sooner, and then have to take a loss on all those repairs. 
As long as the company itself is in good financial health with a stable board of trustees and executives (you can research this through publically available business portfolios, SEC filing, and other materials designed to attract investors), then there is a good chance the confidence the company displays through the warranty is valid and worthy of consideration. 
It is fair to say that many preppers who don’t believe in the value of warranties prefer to stockpile extra items so that they can replace broken or worn items with new ones. 
In this case, if a battery has an average life of 5 years, some preppers might store way 3x the number of needed batteries thinking they will get 15 years out of them. 
Sadly, as soon as batteries are assembled, they begin to break down inside. No matter how you try to rotate them in and out of service, store them, or baby them, they will all become useless at around the same time. 
Overall, you will be better served by giving more weight to the manufacturer warranty for each battery instead of how many batteries you can store away for future use. Video first seen on LDSreliance . 
Batteries You can Choose From Today 
In earlier articles, I discussed the main kinds of batteries that you can use with your solar power system, as well as the advantages and disadvantages associated with each one. 
Please use the following links for more details about some of the more common batteries on the market. Then, as now, I still have no particular favorite in this industry and feel that it is up to each person to weight their personal needs carefully in relation to each battery type. basic battery types such as wet cells, gel batteries, and lithium ion batteries a more detailed look at the pros and cons of Edison batteries a look at a relative newcomer – Tesla Batteries 
Batteries that May be Available Soon 
In the last year, some absolutely amazing batteries came one step closer to being available to consumers. 
Here are my 5 favorites: 
Gold Nanowire Batteries – these batteries make use of ultra thin gold wires suspended in an electrolyte gel. During testing, they were deep cycled several thousand times without being ruined or breaking down. Of all the emerging batteries, this one has the potential to last for decades and beyond. Since they can also be scaled to a size suitable for automobiles, they may also be the perfect battery for preppers. Video first seen on UPHIGH Productions . 
Graphene batteries – basically, graphene batteries make use of carbon arranged into honeycomb like lattices to store energy. The are lighter in weight, last longer, and are much safer than lithium ion batteries. 
At this time, you can purchase graphene batteries and give them a try. I recommend trying out the smaller ones for portable devices before moving on to larger ones to integrate with a solar power system. 
It will also be of some help to keep an eye on emerging technologies that combine graphene batteries with super capacitors and other materials. As innovative as graphene batteries are, there is still plenty of room for even better batteries to be developed in the next year or so. 
Aluminum Air Battery – these fascinating batteries literally run on water and can deliver several times the power of a lithium ion battery. Current models will run for about 14 days before you have to top them off again with tap or salt water. 
Some models of these batteries are supposed to be available in 2016, however it may be some time before you can buy ones large enough to power a household. 
Titanium Dioxide Battery – instead of using carbon, these batteries make use of titanium dioxide. The NTU battery will charge up much faster than conventional batteries, and will last well over 10 years. 
If these batteries come out in the next year or so, I would recommend them over current battery designs. Since these batteries still don’t last as long as some other emerging designs, I’d call them an improvement, but would still keep some money aside for nanowire and other battery types. 
Organic batteries – did you know that a molecule similar to the one found in rhubarb may hold the key to durable batteries that are safer, charge faster, and last longer? While organic batteries are very much in the early stages of development, they deserve some attention from preppers. 
Aside from purchasing pre-made batteries, some of the ideas presented may lend themselves well to creating your own batteries from household or natural materials. 
Without a question, if there is a battery that appeals to preppers, this would be it because of the potential ability to make them at the consumer level. 
While it may still be some time before these batteries are offered for home energy use, they have the capacity to work better and last longer than anything else on the market right now. 
Tip: 
If you must buy batteries for an existing solar power system, then buy   running now. Just try to set some money and resources aside so that you can purchase these newer designs when they become available. 
Other Ways to Produce Even Power Output 
Today, batteries aren’t the only way to provide a steady flow of electricity. Because modern batteries charge slowly and cannot manage sudden spikes in power demands, they are often teamed up with ultra or super capacitors. 
Aside from reducing demands on batteries, these capacitors can also recapture energy that would be lost. Regardless of the battery you choose for your solar power system, it will be well worth your effort to include super capacitors to increase efficiency and stability of power flow. 
Just about all technologies today focus on using various materials to store electricity. But what if we could store heat from the sun, and then convert it to electricity on an “as needed” basis? 
If you are interested in DIY power storage solutions, give some thought to storing heat instead of electricity. 
You might also want to look into ways to store energy into springs or even use motion as a means to keep the energy readily available. 
Take the time now to learn more about how different kinds of energy are translated from one form to another, and also how they can converted to electricity at any stage in the process. Even though every system will lose energy as it converts from one form to another, that option may still be better than having no power storage options available at all. 
Preparing for Social Collapse 
Over the years, I have experienced a good bit of frustration as I have searched for answers to the thorny question of how to produce electricity, and then store it. 
Each time I look at emerging technologies, I seek to test them to see if I will wind up relying on organizations that will charge a fortune for maintenance and equipment replacement. 
Needless to say, I also find it quite vexing when I cannot find all the answers in one place, or one answer does not meet all my needs. 
From that perspective, it seems best to not focus exclusively on just one battery or power storage technology. Here are some steps to take: Try to obtain small versions of different battery types for testing purposes. Instead of using them with a conventional power charger, see how they respond to mini solar panels, body power systems, or anything else you may be working Choose a battery type that seems to work best ,and purchase one or two units that would be suitable to integrate with your solar power system. If they work well, you can opt to purchase enough batteries to power your home, and then wait to see what else becomes available. As newer battery types become available, try to obtain small versions so you can test them out. For example, right now you can purchase graphene batteries and connect them to any number of different systems. If you happen to find a battery that works really well in the smaller sizes, then keep an eye out to see when larger ones become available. Gradually, you can replace older technologies with newer ones and hopefully come out with a better system in the end. For the best long term options, think for yourself and do what you can to explore power storage options that may not be as popular. If you can find something that you can build for yourself, you will be that much closer to the goal of complete and sustainable energy independence. 
As you can see, purchasing batteries for a solar energy system as a prepper isn’t exactly the same as it is for homesteaders and off gridders. While these people still have an interest in good quality batteries that will be reliable and durable, preppers must always take into account what to do in the event of social collapse. 
Therefore, when it comes to choosing the best batteries, you will always need to think past the current time frame and look to future technologies as well as developing your own innovations.

No matter what device you use to turn solar power into electricity, a storage system for the electricity is absolutely essential. Without batteries or some other form of storage, you will not be able to produce an even flow of current or span time gaps when the system produces too little power or none at all. 
While there are many different kinds of batteries on the market that can be used with solar systems, they may not be best for preppers. 
Here are some things you should keep in mind when buying pre-fabricated batteries. 
Understand How the Batteries Will Be Used 
If you don’t want to spend a lot of time figuring out your average household electric consumption, simply go back to your electric bills for one year. Pick the highest bill and look at the amount of electricity you used. Multiply that by about 30% to take into account higher energy drains for unusual weather patterns and you will have some good ideas about how much power the batteries will need to produce per year. 
While power output is a very important part of understanding battery use, it is also important to keep the following factors in mind: Aside from computing average yearly and daily use, it is also very important to know how deeply you can cycle the battery, (essentially how much you can let it drain to almost empty before recharging it) and how often you can do so without damage. Even though modern batteries are connected to systems that reduce the risk of overcharging, there is no way to prevent the battery from being cycled too deeply or too often other than to have more batteries in the system. Make sure that the batteries can safely withstand charging and discharging at the same time. Do not just go by the battery type when making this assessment. Rather, look for testimonials and consumer reports on the actual models of interest to you. If you do not feel confident that the battery can truly handle this type of use, then create a system with two battery banks so that one can be used for powering your home while the other is charging back up again. Aside from the amount of power being drawn from the battery, some devices draw it faster than others. When evaluating batteries for a solar system, make sure you know how quickly they can be discharged without causing damage. You may find cheaper batteries that cannot be drained as quickly, however you may have to switch between devices so that you do not ruin the batteries. 
Long Warranties vs. Stockpiling 
Right now, our nation and world are facing some very serious catastrophes. For the first time in decades, we have a candidate for president “playing chicken” with nuclear armed Russia to the point where Putin says war with the United State is inevitable. 
If that isn’t bad enough, we’ve essentially got all four of the Biblical horsemen of the apocalypse in play: Famine (in the form of crop failures caused by floods, bee shortages, and soil depletion) Disease (super bugs on the rise, deadly vaccines that leave us vulnerable to cancer yet allergic to common foods such as peanut butter and dairy, and food borne illness that may be enhanced by “undocumented citizens” that tend to work in food production) Warfare (terrorism aside, civil war might erupt right beneath our own feet) A pervasive sense of some kind of death march that most don’t even recognize because they have been so heavily brainwashed and bound up into a system of lies, corruption, and greed. 
With all of this going on, it is entirely too easy to disregard warranties because the companies that offer them may not be available to meet their end of the bargain once society collapses past a certain point. 
That being said, neither we, nor these companies actually know when a major disaster will come along. It would be foolhardy, at best for a company to give a longer warranty on something that will fail much sooner, and then have to take a loss on all those repairs. 
As long as the company itself is in good financial health with a stable board of trustees and executives (you can research this through publically available business portfolios, SEC filing, and other materials designed to attract investors), then there is a good chance the confidence the company displays through the warranty is valid and worthy of consideration. 
It is fair to say that many preppers who don’t believe in the value of warranties prefer to stockpile extra items so that they can replace broken or worn items with new ones. 
In this case, if a battery has an average life of 5 years, some preppers might store way 3x the number of needed batteries thinking they will get 15 years out of them. 
Sadly, as soon as batteries are assembled, they begin to break down inside. No matter how you try to rotate them in and out of service, store them, or baby them, they will all become useless at around the same time. 
Overall, you will be better served by giving more weight to the manufacturer warranty for each battery instead of how many batteries you can store away for future use. Video first seen on LDSreliance . 
Batteries You can Choose From Today 
In earlier articles, I discussed the main kinds of batteries that you can use with your solar power system, as well as the advantages and disadvantages associated with each one. 
Please use the following links for more details about some of the more common batteries on the market. Then, as now, I still have no particular favorite in this industry and feel that it is up to each person to weight their personal needs carefully in relation to each battery type. basic battery types such as wet cells, gel batteries, and lithium ion batteries a more detailed look at the pros and cons of Edison batteries a look at a relative newcomer – Tesla Batteries 
Batteries that May be Available Soon 
In the last year, some absolutely amazing batteries came one step closer to being available to consumers. 
Here are my 5 favorites: 
Gold Nanowire Batteries – these batteries make use of ultra thin gold wires suspended in an electrolyte gel. During testing, they were deep cycled several thousand times without being ruined or breaking down. Of all the emerging batteries, this one has the potential to last for decades and beyond. Since they can also be scaled to a size suitable for automobiles, they may also be the perfect battery for preppers. Video first seen on UPHIGH Productions . 
Graphene batteries – basically, graphene batteries make use of carbon arranged into honeycomb like lattices to store energy. The are lighter in weight, last longer, and are much safer than lithium ion batteries. 
At this time, you can purchase graphene batteries and give them a try. I recommend trying out the smaller ones for portable devices before moving on to larger ones to integrate with a solar power system. 
It will also be of some help to keep an eye on emerging technologies that combine graphene batteries with super capacitors and other materials. As innovative as graphene batteries are, there is still plenty of room for even better batteries to be developed in the next year or so. 
Aluminum Air Battery – these fascinating batteries literally run on water and can deliver several times the power of a lithium ion battery. Current models will run for about 14 days before you have to top them off again with tap or salt water. 
Some models of these batteries are supposed to be available in 2016, however it may be some time before you can buy ones large enough to power a household. 
Titanium Dioxide Battery – instead of using carbon, these batteries make use of titanium dioxide. The NTU battery will charge up much faster than conventional batteries, and will last well over 10 years. 
If these batteries come out in the next year or so, I would recommend them over current battery designs. Since these batteries still don’t last as long as some other emerging designs, I’d call them an improvement, but would still keep some money aside for nanowire and other battery types. 
Organic batteries – did you know that a molecule similar to the one found in rhubarb may hold the key to durable batteries that are safer, charge faster, and last longer? While organic batteries are very much in the early stages of development, they deserve some attention from preppers.

no matter device use turn solar power electricity storage system electricity absolutely essential without battery form storage able produce even flow current span time gap system produce little power none 
while many different kind battery market use solar system may best preppers 
here thing keep mind buy pre-fabricated battery 
understand battery use 
if don’t want spend lot time figure average household electric consumption simply go back electric bill one year pick high bill look amount electricity use multiply take account high energy drain unusual weather pattern good idea much power battery need produce per year 
while power output important part understand battery use also important keep follow factor mind aside compute average yearly daily use also important know deeply cycle battery essentially much let drain almost empty recharge often without damage even though modern battery connect system reduce risk overcharge way prevent battery cycle deeply often batteries system make sure battery safely withstand charge discharging time go battery type make assessment rather look testimonial consumer report actual model interest feel confident battery truly handle type use create system two battery bank one use powering home charge back aside amount power drawn battery device draw fast others evaluate battery solar system make sure know quickly discharge without cause damage may find cheap battery cannot drain quickly however may switch device ruin battery 
long warranty vs stockpile 
right nation world face serious catastrophe first time decade candidate president “playing chicken” nuclear arm russia point putin say war united state inevitable 
if isn’t bad enough we’ve essentially get four biblical horseman apocalypse play famine form crop failure cause flood bee shortage soil depletion disease super bug rise deadly vaccine leave u vulnerable cancer yet allergic common food peanut butter dairy food borne illness may enhance “undocumented citizens” tend work food production warfare terrorism aside civil war might erupt right beneath foot pervasive sense kind death march don’t even recognize heavily brainwash bound system lie corruption greed 
with go entirely easy disregard warranty company offer may available meet end bargain society collapse past certain point 
that say neither company actually know major disaster come along would foolhardy best company give long warranty something fail much sooner take loss repair 
as long company good financial health stable board trustees executive research publically available business portfolio sec file material design attract investor good chance confidence company display warranty valid worthy consideration 
it fair say many preppers don’t believe value warranty prefer stockpile extra item replace broken worn item new one 
in case battery average life year preppers might store way number need battery think get year 
sadly soon battery assemble begin break inside matter try rotate service store baby become useless around time 
overall well serve give weight manufacturer warranty battery instead many battery store away future use video first see ldsreliance 
batteries choose today 
in early article discuss main kind battery use solar power system well advantage disadvantage associate one 
please use follow link detail common battery market still particular favorite industry feel person weight personal need carefully relation battery type basic battery type wet cell gel battery lithium ion battery detail look pro con edison battery look relative newcomer tesla battery 
batteries may available soon 
in last year absolutely amazing battery come one step closer available consumer 
here favorites 
gold nanowire battery battery make use ultra thin gold wire suspend electrolyte gel test deep cycle several thousand time without ruined break emerge battery one potential last decade beyond since also scale size suitable automobile may also perfect battery preppers video first see uphigh production 
graphene battery basically graphene battery make use carbon arrange honeycomb like lattice store energy lighter weight last longer much safe lithium ion battery 
at time purchase graphene battery give try recommend try small one portable device move large one integrate solar power system 
it also help keep eye emerge technology combine graphene battery super capacitor material innovative graphene battery still plenty room even good battery develop next year 
aluminum air battery fascinate battery literally run water deliver several time power lithium ion battery current model run day top tap salt water 
some model battery suppose available however may time buy one large enough power household 
titanium dioxide battery instead use carbon battery make use titanium dioxide ntu battery charge much faster conventional battery last well year 
if battery come next year would recommend current battery design since battery still don’t last long emerge design i’d call improvement would still keep money aside nanowire battery type 
organic battery know molecule similar one find rhubarb may hold key durable battery safer charge faster last long organic battery much early stage development deserve attention preppers 
aside purchase pre-made battery idea present may lend well create battery household natural material 
without question battery appeal preppers would potential ability make consumer level 
while may still time battery offer home energy use capacity work well last longer anything else market right 
tip 
if must buy battery exist solar power system buy run try set money resource aside purchase new design become available 
other way produce even power output 
today battery aren’t way provide steady flow electricity modern battery charge slowly cannot manage sudden spike power demand often team ultra super capacitor 
aside reduce demand battery capacitor also recapture energy would lose regardless battery choose solar power system well worth effort include super capacitor increase efficiency stability power flow 
just technology today focus use various material store electricity could store heat sun convert electricity “as needed” basis 
if interest diy power storage solution give think store heat instead electricity 
you might also want look way store energy spring even use motion mean keep energy readily available 
take time learn different kind energy translate one form another also convert electricity stage process even though every system lose energy convert one form another option may still better power storage option available 
preparing social collapse 
over year experience good bit frustration search answer thorny question produce electricity store 
each time look emerge technology seek test see wind rely organization charge fortune maintenance equipment replacement 
needless say also find quite vex cannot find answer one place one answer meet need 
from perspective seem best focus exclusively one battery power storage technology step take try obtain small version different battery type test purpose instead use conventional power charger see respond mini solar panel body power system anything else may work choose battery type seem work best purchase one two unit would suitable integrate solar power system work well opt purchase enough battery power home wait see else becomes available new battery type become available try obtain small version test example right purchase graphene battery connect number different system happen find battery work really well small sizes keep eye see large one become available gradually replace old technology new one hopefully come good system end best long term option think explore power storage option may popular find something build much close goal complete sustainable energy independence 
as see purchase battery solar energy system prepper isn’t exactly homesteaders gridders people still interest good quality battery reliable durable preppers must always take account event social collapse 
therefore come choose best battery always need think past current time frame look future technology well develop innovation

1623,"After Obama changes tack on Syria, what would the presidential candidates do?","Barack Obama’s announcement on Friday that American special forces will take a more active role in the war in Syria is for many critics of his foreign policy a confirmation that the US has inched deeper into a chaotic conflict.

It’s also an opportunity for presidential candidates to both praise and denounce him. And most Republican and Democratic presidential candidates propose doing even more than the raids that Obama has authorized, which skeptics call “mission creep”. The war pits the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, against various rebels and the jihadi group Islamic State, and now involves the US, Russia, Iran, Gulf states, Turkey, the Kurds and Iraq. Here’s how foreign policy might look under the ideas of potential presidents.

Nearly all the candidates of both parties have called for a no-fly zone over Syria, arguing that denying Assad’s air force will better protect civilians and rebels from bombing runs.

“A superpower can impose a no-fly zone if it decides it wants to,” said Stephen Biddle, a professor of international affairs at George Washington University. “But the problems are it’s very expensive, no one is willing to pay the price, and these days there are serious risks of escalation.”

A no-fly zone would require far more airstrikes on airfields and anti-aircraft batteries, for instance, putting American pilots in danger against Syrian missiles and jets. Russia’s entry into the war further complicates the proposal, increasing the risk of shooting down Russian aircraft bombing rebels.

And while a future president could warn Vladimir Putin to fly strikes at his own peril, the US stands to lose more should Putin simply continue strikes. An American president’s choice would then be to stand down or risk a wider, far more dangerous war – and political disaster at home – by firing on Russian pilots.

Nor would a no-fly zone offer certain protection to civilians or rebels whom an American president finds acceptable. Most of the war’s dead – civilian or combatant – have not been killed from the air but on the ground, by bullets, mortars and artillery shells, according to the Violations Documentation Center.

The statistics suggest a no-fly zone would not do much to staunch the bleeding of civilians or any friendly rebels. In contrast, Russia’s strategy of indiscriminate bombing boosts Assad’s much more limited aims, which do not take civilian casualties into account.

Only Republican Rand Paul and Democrats Martin O’Malley and Bernie Sanders oppose a no-fly zone.

Billionaire Donald Trump has maintained that “safe zones” on the ground in Syria and Iraq would help end the war and solve the refugee crisis, and said that Turkey and the Gulf states of Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar should lead the effort with US help.

But while a ground campaign could defend civilians from the deadliest threats, it would also entail all the dangers of mission creep and the painstaking logistics of a war effort. One American has already died in a raid on an Isis facility, and a Russian soldier died in Syria last week.

“To keep it safe would require fighting,” the defense secretary, Ash Carter, told Congress on Tuesday. “You need to think in each case … who’s in, who is kept out and how the enforcement of it is done.”

Any campaign would probably need snipers, radar and recon teams, artillery and special operations teams – if not full infantry battalions, Micah Zenko, a senior fellow at the Council of Foreign Relations, has noted in Foreign Policy.

“The types of interventions that proponents have endorsed for Syria are often based on deep misunderstandings of how US force was used on behalf of humanitarian missions in the past,” Zenko wrote. “Proposals that consciously ignore or downplay the amount and type of force needed to protect civilians are just wishful thinking.”

Biddle agreed, adding that another problem is that safe zones offer cover to both civilians and combatants.

“Say you set up a safe zone along the Turkish-Syrian border, and lo and behold guerrillas start operating within it, and the government starts firing artillery into it. What do you do then? Silence the artillery by expanding your perimeter? Push the perimeter until it’s all of Syria?”

He also noted the problem of policing – for instance, the dilemma of a suspected rebel whose family vouches for the person’s innocence.

“You don’t have to walk very far down the thought experiment to end up with all sorts of problems and ambiguities,” Biddle said.

Senator Marco Rubio is the most vocal supporter of embedding special forces with rebel and Kurdish ground troops.

Most of the candidates support arms for rebels, though few have specified which groups they find acceptable and how they would vet them – the same problems that have slowed Pentagon efforts in the last two years.

More problematically, most of the Syrian rebels eager for weapons and aid are not interested in a concerted fight against Isis. “While there are tens of thousands of rebels willing to receive training and equipment to go after the Assad regime, few are willing to fight the Islamic State,” Zenko wrote earlier this year.

Arming anti-Assad rebels may suit US interests, but it would also pit the US against Russia and Iran in a proxy war. Even regional allies disagree with American priorities about Isis, Biddle noted, which is why Turkey continues to bomb Kurds and Saudi Arabia and the UAE arm groups around the region, most notably in Syria but also in the ruins of Yemen. These same conflicted interests make it unlikely that the nations would ever band together to form their own “safe zone”.

“They all have bigger fish to fry,” he said. “We’re the biggest, but we’re the only one who thinks Isil is the threat to be resolved first.”

Although Kurdish fighters have proven the most reliable allies for US ground offensives, Turkish warplanes have increased bombing sorties against Kurdish forces in Syria and Iraq, meaning increased arms for the Kurds could fuel a war between two American allies on yet another border.

Arming Kurdish fighters could also lead to the US supplying groups that it has named terrorists, if it hasn’t inadvertently done so already. In October Amnesty International accused the Kurdish group YPG of human rights violations.

Rubio, Jeb Bush and Lindsey Graham have spoken strongly in favor of arming Syrian rebel groups and Kurds, Ted Cruz has called for directly arming the Kurds, Hillary Clinton urged arms for rebels and Kurds while she was secretary of state, and even O’Malley has said the US should “probably” arm the fighters.

All candidates except Senator Rand Paul have said they support Obama’s decision to extend the US military presence in Afghanistan to 2017, though a handful say they only do so out of deference to the generals’ advice.

But the presence of 5,500 to 10,000 troops, as the president and candidates prescribe, would have little effect on the war against the Taliban, experts said. Most said a steady run of airstrikes had prevented the Taliban from massing, and that the end of “combat operations” – resulting in a lull in airstrikes – had given the militants opportunity to retake cities and regroup.

The spread of American troops at four airbases around Afghanistan and continued airstrikes – including one that bombed a hospital – suggests Obama plans to let generals use as much airpower as possible to support Afghan forces. But neither he nor any candidate has shown any appetite for a major reinforcement.

Barring dramatic changes to Barack Obama’s plans and the politics of the Middle East, 2017 will begin with 5,500 troops across Afghanistan and a number of special forces teams operating in Syria and Iraq.

Paul, Trump and Cruz have all offered variations on a plan that could see US forces withdraw from the region, ceding a lead military role to Russia and Iran but continuing airstrikes against Isis. But while staying out of foreign conflicts has appeal at home to Democrats and Republicans alike – and arguably supports US interests – “it still sacrifices interests that are real, even if they’re limited,” Biddle said.

“There’s the prospective future terrorist threat of an ungoverned region, the risk of a war if that metastasizes and spreads,” he said. “If you wash your hands of it, you’re running a social science experiment to sit back and see how many of these bad things unfold. That’s a really bad choice for a person that has the power to make a difference.”

Not least on the minds of the president or any would-be commander in chief, he added, was that to do nothing “hands the opposition a bunch of really obvious talking points”.","After Obama changes tack on Syria, what would the presidential candidates do?

3385,State Department won’t rule out $50B ‘signing bonus’ for Iran,"The State Department on Monday would not rule out giving Iran up to $50 billion as a so-called ""signing bonus"" for agreeing to a nuclear deal later this year, according to comments made to journalists following reports that the Obama administration had formulated a plan to release tens of billions of frozen Iranian funds.

Experts have said this multi-billion dollar ""signing bonus"" option, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, could be the largest cash infusion to a terror-backing regime in recent memory.

A cash release of $30 to $50 billion upon reaching a final nuclear agreement would come in addition to the more than $11 billion in unfrozen assets that Iran will already have received under an interim nuclear accord reached in 2013.

When asked to address these reports on Monday, State Department Spokeswoman Marie Harf attempted to dodge the issue and then accused reporters of getting ""spun up"" on the issue.

Asked whether Iran could receive $50 billion ""on day one after signing"" or verbally agreeing to a nuclear deal, Harf told reporters that she would ""look into it.""

When pressed to provide an answer about the Journal's initial report, Harf declined ""to go line by line in the story.""

Harf said sanctions relief to Iran will continue through June 30.

2861,White House willing to sign compromise Iran bill,"(CNN) After months of tensions with Congress over a bill giving the legislature a say in the potential Iran nuclear deal, the White House indicated Tuesday that the president would be willing to sign the compromise version of the measure.

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee unanimously approved the new version, which Democratic lobbying had watered down, in a vote Tuesday afternoon.

During his daily press briefing, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said President Barack Obama would approve the measure as it stands now, though Earnest noted he can't commit to that position if the legislation changes.

The White House ""certainly"" blinked, Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake said Tuesday on CNN's ""The Situation Room.""

""Congress imposed the sanctions and only Congress can lift them permanently. So we always had a role and I'm glad the White House recognizes that now,"" he said.

Earlier Tuesday, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said they had resolved key differences on the bill regarding Iran's nuclear plan, making the bill's passage more certain.

""What I'm most proud of is we've kept the pure integrity of the process in place and the President cannot lift -- while Congress is reviewing this -- cannot lift the congressionally mandated sanctions, which is what they've been trying to do and push for over the past couple of weeks,"" Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker told reporters Tuesday, as he headed into a classified briefing on the emerging Iran agreement with Secretary of State John Kerry and other top administration officials.

Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio said during the committee's deliberations in the afternoon that he would not offer a controversial amendment related to Israel. Other senators also dropped their amendments to ensure this agreement stayed intact.

According to a Corker aide familiar with the details of the bill, it requires Obama to submit the final agreement to Congress, which will have up to 52 days to weigh in on the deal. That includes an initial review period of 30 days, with 12 more days added automatically if Congress passes a bill and sends it to the President, and an additional 10 days of congressional review if Obama vetoes the legislation.

If the deal is submitted late, after July 9, the review period reverts to 60 days.

During that time, the President is prohibited from waiving the congressional sanctions. And Obama is required by the legislation to certify to Congress every 90 days that Iran is complying with the terms of the deal.

The bill also requires the President to make a series of detailed reports to Congress on a range of issues, including Iran's nuclear program, its ballistic missiles work and its support for terrorism globally, particularly against the U.S. and its allies.

Sen. Ben Cardin, the committee's top Democrat, expressed optimism Monday night that negotiators could come to an agreement that would appease the White House while maintaining the ultimate goal of requiring congressional approval.

""I think we can get to a place where we can deal with most of the White House's concerns and maintain the purpose of the bill, which is an orderly congressional review and timely notice if there are material breaches,"" he said ahead of the compromise being reached.

Congressional negotiators worked through the weekend and into the night Monday to hammer out legislation that would draw enough support from hardline Republicans and moderate Democrats to pass.

House Speaker John Boehner on Tuesday said he expected the House to take up the Corker bill once the full Senate votes on it, saying the proposal has taken ""center stage.""

He reiterated his stance that Congress should ""absolutely have the opportunity to review the deal,"" adding the administration ""appears to want a deal at any cost.""

But he brushed off the notion that he was working to derail the nuclear deal.","White House willing to sign compromise Iran bill (CNN) After months of tensions with Congress over a bill giving the legislature a say in the potential Iran nuclear deal, the White House indicated Tuesday that the president would be willing to sign the compromise version of the measure.

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee unanimously approved the new version, which Democratic lobbying had watered down, in a vote Tuesday afternoon.

During his daily press briefing, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said President Barack Obama would approve the measure as it stands now, though Earnest noted he can't commit to that position if the legislation changes.

The White House ""certainly"" blinked, Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake said Tuesday on CNN's ""The Situation Room.""

""Congress imposed the sanctions and only Congress can lift them permanently. So we always had a role and I'm glad the White House recognizes that now,"" he said.

Earlier Tuesday, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said they had resolved key differences on the bill regarding Iran's nuclear plan, making the bill's passage more certain.

""What I'm most proud of is we've kept the pure integrity of the process in place and the President cannot lift -- while Congress is reviewing this -- cannot lift the congressionally mandated sanctions, which is what they've been trying to do and push for over the past couple of weeks,"" Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker told reporters Tuesday, as he headed into a classified briefing on the emerging Iran agreement with Secretary of State John Kerry and other top administration officials.

Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio said during the committee's deliberations in the afternoon that he would not offer a controversial amendment related to Israel. Other senators also dropped their amendments to ensure this agreement stayed intact.

According to a Corker aide familiar with the details of the bill, it requires Obama to submit the final agreement to Congress, which will have up to 52 days to weigh in on the deal. That includes an initial review period of 30 days, with 12 more days added automatically if Congress passes a bill and sends it to the President, and an additional 10 days of congressional review if Obama vetoes the legislation.

If the deal is submitted late, after July 9, the review period reverts to 60 days.

During that time, the President is prohibited from waiving the congressional sanctions. And Obama is required by the legislation to certify to Congress every 90 days that Iran is complying with the terms of the deal.

The bill also requires the President to make a series of detailed reports to Congress on a range of issues, including Iran's nuclear program, its ballistic missiles work and its support for terrorism globally, particularly against the U.S. and its allies.

Sen. Ben Cardin, the committee's top Democrat, expressed optimism Monday night that negotiators could come to an agreement that would appease the White House while maintaining the ultimate goal of requiring congressional approval.

""I think we can get to a place where we can deal with most of the White House's concerns and maintain the purpose of the bill, which is an orderly congressional review and timely notice if there are material breaches,"" he said ahead of the compromise being reached.

1774,The toughest job in American politics? Defending Hillary Clinton,"The toughest job in politics these days is defending Hillary Clinton, mocked brilliantly by The New York Post as the “Deleter of the Free World.”

Her beleaguered defenders, as they retreat behind the bunker door, are settling on a crude legal defense.

Their mumbo jumbo chorus -- begins with the claim that she didn’t break any laws by doing government business on her private email and ends with the insistence that everybody does it.

That’s their story, and they are sticking to it — until they are forced to find another one.

That will be soon because, while Hillary’s Helpers may have a point about fuzzy laws, their argument is ultimately futile. She’s not on trial and opponents don’t have to meet a persnickety legal standard to win their case.

She’s running for president — and she must meet a less precise but more difficult standard. It’s the test of integrity, and she’s failed it often during her 30 years in public life.

10308,Explosive Assange/Pilger Interview on US Election: Expect Riots if Hillary Wins,"By wmw_admin on November 6, 2016 Darkmoon — Nov 6, 2016 RT : “Whistleblower Julian Assange has given one of his most incendiary interviews ever in a John Pilger Special [released late yesterday] courtesy of Dartmouth Films. Here he summarizes what can be gleaned from the tens of thousands of Clinton emails leaked by WikiLeaks this year.” LD : Despite the enormous populist support for Trump and the extraordinary loathing in which Hillary Clinton is held by millions of American, Assange says that “Trump cannot be allowed to win.” Trump has already indicated that he will not recognize the result of the election if he loses, given the enormous enthusiasm he has generated during his speeches, compared to the relatively tepid and anaemic response evoked by Hillary Clinton on similar occasions. Recent news reports reveal that “election related violence is increasing and Right-wing armed militia groups are even preparing for unrest if Mrs Clinton ‘steals’ the election, as they fear will happen.” If Hillary Clinton wins this election, as Assange predicts, we can expect riots to erupt all across America. Violent insurrection, in the circumstances of a rigged election, would appear to be more than justified. Hillary Clinton clearly belongs behind bars, not in the White House. [LD] John Pilger (left) conducted the 25-minute interview at the Ecuadorian Embassy where Assange has been trapped since 2012 for fear of extradition to the US. Here is a transcript of the interview followed by the YouTube interview itself. Click to enlarge THE SECRET WORLD OF THE US ELECTION John Pilger: What’s the significance of the FBI’s intervention in these last days of the U.S. election campaign, in the case against Hillary Clinton? Julian Assange: If you look at the history of the FBI, it has become effectively America’s political police. The FBI demonstrated this by taking down the former head of the CIA General David Petraeus over classified information given to his mistress. Almost no-one is untouchable. The FBI is always trying to demonstrate that no-one can resist us. But Hillary Clinton very conspicuously resisted the FBI’s investigation, so there’s anger within the FBI because it made the FBI look weak. We’ve published about 33,000 of Clinton’s emails when she was Secretary of State. They come from a batch of just over 60,000 emails, [of which] Clinton has kept about half — 30,000 — to herself, and we’ve published about half. Then there are the Podesta emails we’ve been publishing. John Podesta is Hillary Clinton’s primary campaign manager, so there’s a thread that runs through all these emails; there are quite a lot of pay-for-play, as they call it, giving access in exchange for money to states, individuals and corporations. These emails are combined with the cover up of the Hillary Clinton emails when she was Secretary of State, which has led to an environment where the pressure on the FBI increases. ‘Russian government not the source of Clinton leaks’ PILGER : The Clinton campaign has said that Russia is behind all of this, that Russia has manipulated the campaign and is the source for WikiLeaks and its emails. ASSANGE : The Clinton camp has been able to project that kind of neo-McCarthy hysteria: that Russia is responsible for everything. Hilary Clinton stated multiple times, falsely, that seventeen U.S. intelligence agencies had assessed that Russia was the source of our publications. That is false; we can say that the Russian government is not the source. ‘Saudi Arabia & Qatar funding ISIS and Clinton’ PILGER : The emails that give evidence of access for money and how Hillary Clinton herself benefited from this and how she is benefitting politically, are quite extraordinary. I’m thinking of when the Qatari representative was given five minutes with Bill Clinton for a million dollar cheque. ASSANGE : And twelve million dollars from Morocco … PILGER : Twelve million from Morocco, yeah. ASSANGE : For Hillary Clinton to attend a party. PILGER : In terms of the foreign policy of the United States, that’s where the emails are most revealing, where they show the direct connection between Hillary Clinton and the foundation of jihadism, of ISIL, in the Middle East. Can you talk about how the emails demonstrate the connection between those who are meant to be fighting the jihadists of ISIL, are actually those who have helped create it. ASSANGE : There’s an early 2014 email from Hillary Clinton, not so long after she left the State Department, to her campaign manager John Podesta that states ISIL is funded by the governments of Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Now this is the most significant email in the whole collection, and perhaps because Saudi and Qatari money is spread all over the Clinton Foundation. Even the U.S. government agrees that some Saudi figures have been supporting ISIL, or ISIS. But the dodge has always been that, well it’s just some rogue Princes, using their cut of the oil money to do whatever they like, but actually the government disapproves. But that email says that no, it is the governments of Saudi and Qatar that have been funding ISIS. PILGER : The Saudis, the Qataris, the Moroccans, the Bahrainis, particularly the Saudis and the Qataris, are giving all this money to the Clinton Foundation while Hilary Clinton is Secretary of State and the State Department is approving massive arms sales, particularly to Saudi Arabia. ASSANGE : Under Hillary Clinton, the world’s largest ever arms deal was made with Saudi Arabia, worth more than $80 billion. In fact, during her tenure as Secretary of State, total arms exports from the United States in terms of the dollar value, doubled. PILGER : Of course the consequence of that is that the notorious terrorist group called ISIl or ISIS is created largely with money from the very people who are giving money to the Clinton Foundation. ASSANGE : Yes. PILGER : That’s extraordinary. ‘Clinton has been eaten alive by her ambition’ ASSANGE : I actually feel quite sorry for Hillary Clinton as a person because I see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions, tormented literally to the point where they become sick; they faint as a result of the reaction to their ambitions. She represents a whole network of people and a network of relationships with particular states. The question is how does Hilary Clinton fit in this broader network? She’s a centralising cog. You’ve got a lot of different gears in operation from the big banks like Goldman Sachs and major elements of Wall Street, and Intelligence and people in the State Department and the Saudis. She’s the centraliser that inter-connects all these different cogs. She’s the smooth central representation of all that, and ‘all that’ is more or less what is in power now in the United States. It’s what we call the establishment or the DC consensus. One of the more significant Podesta emails that we released was about how the Obama cabinet was formed and how half the Obama cabinet was basically nominated by a representative from City Bank. This is quite amazing. PILGER : Didn’t Citybank supply a list… ? ASSANGE : Yes. PILGER : Which turned out to be most of the Obama cabinet? ASSANGE : Yes. PILGER : So Wall Street decides the cabinet of the President of the United States? ASSANGE : If you were following the Obama campaign back then, closely, you could see it had become very close to banking interests. So I think you can’t properly understand Hillary Clinton’s foreign policy without understanding Saudi Arabia. The connections with Saudi Arabia are so intimate. ‘Libya is Hillary Clinton’s war’ PILGER : Why was she so demonstrably enthusiastic about the destruction of Libya? Can you talk a little about just what the emails have told us – told you – about what happened there? Because Libya is such a source for so much of the mayhem now in Syria: the ISIL, jihadism, and so on. And it was almost Hillary Clinton’s invasion. What do the emails tell us about that? ASSANGE : Libya, more than anyone else’s war, was Hillary Clinton’s war. Barak Obama initially opposed it. Who was the person championing it? Hillary Clinton. That’s documented throughout her emails. She had put her favoured agent, Sidney Blumenthal, on to that; there’s more than 1700 emails out of the thirty three thousand Hillary Clinton emails that we’ve published, just about Libya. It’s not that Libya has cheap oil. She perceived the removal of Gaddafi and the overthrow of the Libyan state — something that she would use in her run-up to the general election for President. So in late 2011 there is an internal document called the Libya Tick Tock that was produced for Hillary Clinton, and it’s the chronological description of how she was the central figure in the destruction of the Libyan state, which resulted in around 40,000 deaths within Libya; jihadists moved in, ISIS moved in, leading to the European refugee and migrant crisis. Not only did you have people fleeing Libya, people fleeing Syria, the destabilisation of other African countries as a result of arms flows, but the Libyan state itself err was no longer able to control the movement of people through it. Libya faces along to the Mediterranean and had been effectively the cork in the bottle of Africa. So all problems, economic problems and civil war in Africa — previously people fleeing those problems didn’t end up in Europe because Libya policed the Mediterranean. That was said explicitly at the time, back in early 2011 by Gaddafi: ‘What do these Europeans think they’re doing, trying to bomb and destroy the Libyan State? There’s going to be floods of migrants out of Africa and jihadists into Europe, and this is exactly what happened. ‘Trump won’t be permitted to win’ PILGER : You get complaints from people saying, ‘What is WikiLeaks doing? Are they trying to put Trump in the White House?’ ASSANGE : My answer is that Trump would not be permitted to win. Why do I say that? Because he’s had every establishment off side; Trump doesn’t have one establishment, maybe with the exception of the Evangelicals, if you can call them an establishment, but banks, intelligence agencies, arms companies… big foreign money … are all united behind Hillary Clinton, and the media as well, media owners and even journalists themselves. PILGER : There is the accusation that WikiLeaks is in league with the Russians. Some people say, ‘Well, why doesn’t WikiLeaks investigate and publish emails on Russia?’ ASSANGE : We have published about 800,000 documents of various kinds that relate to Russia. Most of those are critical; and a great many books have come out of our publications about Russia, most of which are critical. Our Russia documents have gone on to be used in quite a number of court cases: refugee cases of people fleeing some kind of claimed political persecution in Russia, which they use our documents to back up. PILGER : Do you yourself take a view of the U.S. election? Do you have a preference for Clinton or Trump? ASSANGE : Let’s talk about Donald Trump. What does he represent in the American mind and in the European mind? He represents American white trash, which Hillary Clinton called ‘deplorable and irredeemable’. It means from an establishment or educated cosmopolitan, urbane perspective, these people are like the red necks, and you can never deal with them. Because he so clearly — through his words and actions and the type of people that turn up at his rallies — represents people who are not the middle, not the upper middle educated class, there is a fear of seeming to be associated in any way with them, a social fear that lowers the class status of anyone who can be accused of somehow assisting Trump in any way, including any criticism of Hillary Clinton. If you look at how the middle class gains its economic and social power, that makes absolute sense. ‘US attempting to squeeze WikiLeaks through my refugee status’ PILGER : I’d like to talk about Ecuador, the small country that has given you refuge and political asylum in this embassy in London. Now Ecuador has cut off the internet from here where we’re doing this interview, in the Embassy, for the clearly obvious reason that they are concerned about appearing to intervene in the U.S. election campaign. Can you talk about why they would take that action and your own views on Ecuador’s support for you? ASSANGE : Let’s let go back four years. I made an asylum application to Ecuador in this embassy, because of the U.S. extradition case, and the result was that after a month, I was successful in my asylum application. The embassy since then has been surrounded by police: quite an expensive police operation which the British government admits to spending more than £12.6 million. They admitted that over a year ago. Now there’s undercover police and there are robot surveillance cameras of various kinds — so that there has been quite a serious conflict right here in the heart of London between Ecuador, a country of sixteen million people, and the United Kingdom, and the Americans who have been helping on the side. So that was a brave and principled thing for Ecuador to do. Now we have the U.S. election campaign, the Ecuadorian election is in February next year, and you have the White House feeling the political heat as a result of the true information that we have been publishing. WikiLeaks does not publish from the jurisdiction of Ecuador, from this embassy or in the territory of Ecuador; we publish from France, we publish from, from Germany, we publish from The Netherlands and from a number of other countries, so that the attempted squeeze on WikiLeaks is through my refugee status; and this is, this is really intolerable. It means that [they] are trying to get at a publishing organisation; they try and prevent it from publishing true information that is of intense interest to the American people and others about an election. PILGER : Tell us what would happen if you walked out of this embassy. ASSANGE : I would be immediately arrested by the British police and I would then be extradited either immediately to the United States or to Sweden. In Sweden I am not charged, I have already been previously cleared by the Senior Stockholm Prosecutor Eva Finne. We were not certain exactly what would happen there, but then we know that the Swedish government has refused to say that they will not extradite me to the United States we know they have extradited 100 per cent of people whom the U.S. has requested since at least 2000. So over the last fifteen years, every single person the U.S. has tried to extradite from Sweden has been extradited, and they refuse to provide a guarantee [that won’t happen]. PILGER : People often ask me how you cope with the isolation in here. ASSANGE : Look, one of the best attributes of human beings is that they’re adaptable; one of the worst attributes of human beings is they are adaptable. They adapt and start to tolerate abuses, they adapt to being involved themselves in abuses, they adapt to adversity and they continue on. So in my situation, frankly, I’m a bit institutionalised — this [the embassy] is the world … it’s visually the world for me. PILGER : It’s the world without sunlight, for one thing, isn’t it? ASSANGE : It’s the world without sunlight, but I haven’t seen sunlight in so long, I don’t remember it. PILGER : Yes. ASSANGE : So , yes, you adapt. The one real irritant is that my young children — they also adapt. They adapt to being without their father. That’s a hard, hard adaption which they didn’t ask for. PILGER : Do you worry about them? ASSANGE : Yes, I worry about them; I worry about their mother. ‘I am innocent and in arbitrary detention’ PILGER : Some people would say, ‘Well, why don’t you end it and simply walk out the door and allow yourself to be extradited to Sweden?’ ASSANGE : The U.N. [the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention] has looked into this whole situation. They spent eighteen months in formal, adversarial litigation. So it’s me and the U.N. verses Sweden and the U.K. Who’s right? The U.N. made a conclusion that I am being arbitrarily detained illegally, deprived of my freedom and that what has occurred has not occurred within the laws that the United Kingdom and Sweden, and that those countries must obey. It is an illegal abuse. It is the United Nations formally asking, ‘What’s going on here? What is your legal explanation for this? Assange says that you should recognise his asylum.’ And here is. Sweden formally writing back to the United Nations to say, ‘No, we’re not going to recognise the UN ruling, so leaving open their ability to extradite. I just find it absolutely amazing that the narrative about this situation is not put out publically in the press, because it doesn’t suit the Western establishment narrative — that yes, the West has political prisoners, it’s a reality, it’s not just me, there’s a bunch of other people as well. The West has political prisoners. Of course, no state accepts that it should call the people it is imprisoning or detaining for political reasons, political prisoners. They don’t call them political prisoners in China, they don’t call them political prisoners in Azerbaijan and they don’t call them political prisoners in the United States, U.K. or Sweden; it is absolutely intolerable to have that kind of self-perception. ASSANGE : Here we have a case, the Swedish case, where I have never been charged with a crime, where I have already been cleared by the Stockholm prosecutor and found to be innocent, where the woman herself said that the police made it up, where the United Nations formally said the whole thing is illegal, where the State of Ecuador also investigated and found that I should be given asylum. Those are the facts, but what is the rhetoric? PILGER : Yes, it’s different. ASSANGE : The rhetoric is pretending, constantly pretending that I have been charged with a crime, and never mentioning that I have been already previously cleared, never mentioning that the woman herself says that the police made it up. The rhetoric is trying to avoid the truth that the U.N. formally found that the whole thing is illegal, never even mentioning that Ecuador made a formal assessment through its formal processes and found that yes, I am subject to persecution by the United States.","Explosive Assange/Pilger Interview on US Election: Expect Riots if Hillary Wins By wmw_admin on November 6, 2016 Darkmoon — Nov 6, 2016 RT : “Whistleblower Julian Assange has given one of his most incendiary interviews ever in a John Pilger Special [released late yesterday] courtesy of Dartmouth Films. Here he summarizes what can be gleaned from the tens of thousands of Clinton emails leaked by WikiLeaks this year.” LD : Despite the enormous populist support for Trump and the extraordinary loathing in which Hillary Clinton is held by millions of American, Assange says that “Trump cannot be allowed to win.” Trump has already indicated that he will not recognize the result of the election if he loses, given the enormous enthusiasm he has generated during his speeches, compared to the relatively tepid and anaemic response evoked by Hillary Clinton on similar occasions. Recent news reports reveal that “election related violence is increasing and Right-wing armed militia groups are even preparing for unrest if Mrs Clinton ‘steals’ the election, as they fear will happen.” If Hillary Clinton wins this election, as Assange predicts, we can expect riots to erupt all across America. Violent insurrection, in the circumstances of a rigged election, would appear to be more than justified. Hillary Clinton clearly belongs behind bars, not in the White House. [LD] John Pilger (left) conducted the 25-minute interview at the Ecuadorian Embassy where Assange has been trapped since 2012 for fear of extradition to the US. Here is a transcript of the interview followed by the YouTube interview itself. Click to enlarge THE SECRET WORLD OF THE US ELECTION John Pilger: What’s the significance of the FBI’s intervention in these last days of the U.S. election campaign, in the case against Hillary Clinton? Julian Assange: If you look at the history of the FBI, it has become effectively America’s political police. The FBI demonstrated this by taking down the former head of the CIA General David Petraeus over classified information given to his mistress. Almost no-one is untouchable. The FBI is always trying to demonstrate that no-one can resist us. But Hillary Clinton very conspicuously resisted the FBI’s investigation, so there’s anger within the FBI because it made the FBI look weak. We’ve published about 33,000 of Clinton’s emails when she was Secretary of State. They come from a batch of just over 60,000 emails, [of which] Clinton has kept about half — 30,000 — to herself, and we’ve published about half. Then there are the Podesta emails we’ve been publishing. John Podesta is Hillary Clinton’s primary campaign manager, so there’s a thread that runs through all these emails; there are quite a lot of pay-for-play, as they call it, giving access in exchange for money to states, individuals and corporations. These emails are combined with the cover up of the Hillary Clinton emails when she was Secretary of State, which has led to an environment where the pressure on the FBI increases. ‘Russian government not the source of Clinton leaks’ PILGER : The Clinton campaign has said that Russia is behind all of this, that Russia has manipulated the campaign and is the source for WikiLeaks and its emails. ASSANGE : The Clinton camp has been able to project that kind of neo-McCarthy hysteria: that Russia is responsible for everything. Hilary Clinton stated multiple times, falsely, that seventeen U.S. intelligence agencies had assessed that Russia was the source of our publications. That is false; we can say that the Russian government is not the source. ‘Saudi Arabia & Qatar funding ISIS and Clinton’ PILGER : The emails that give evidence of access for money and how Hillary Clinton herself benefited from this and how she is benefitting politically, are quite extraordinary. I’m thinking of when the Qatari representative was given five minutes with Bill Clinton for a million dollar cheque. ASSANGE : And twelve million dollars from Morocco … PILGER : Twelve million from Morocco, yeah. ASSANGE : For Hillary Clinton to attend a party. PILGER : In terms of the foreign policy of the United States, that’s where the emails are most revealing, where they show the direct connection between Hillary Clinton and the foundation of jihadism, of ISIL, in the Middle East. Can you talk about how the emails demonstrate the connection between those who are meant to be fighting the jihadists of ISIL, are actually those who have helped create it. ASSANGE : There’s an early 2014 email from Hillary Clinton, not so long after she left the State Department, to her campaign manager John Podesta that states ISIL is funded by the governments of Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Now this is the most significant email in the whole collection, and perhaps because Saudi and Qatari money is spread all over the Clinton Foundation. Even the U.S. government agrees that some Saudi figures have been supporting ISIL, or ISIS. But the dodge has always been that, well it’s just some rogue Princes, using their cut of the oil money to do whatever they like, but actually the government disapproves. But that email says that no, it is the governments of Saudi and Qatar that have been funding ISIS. PILGER : The Saudis, the Qataris, the Moroccans, the Bahrainis, particularly the Saudis and the Qataris, are giving all this money to the Clinton Foundation while Hilary Clinton is Secretary of State and the State Department is approving massive arms sales, particularly to Saudi Arabia. ASSANGE : Under Hillary Clinton, the world’s largest ever arms deal was made with Saudi Arabia, worth more than $80 billion. In fact, during her tenure as Secretary of State, total arms exports from the United States in terms of the dollar value, doubled. PILGER : Of course the consequence of that is that the notorious terrorist group called ISIl or ISIS is created largely with money from the very people who are giving money to the Clinton Foundation. ASSANGE : Yes. PILGER : That’s extraordinary. ‘Clinton has been eaten alive by her ambition’ ASSANGE : I actually feel quite sorry for Hillary Clinton as a person because I see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions, tormented literally to the point where they become sick; they faint as a result of the reaction to their ambitions. She represents a whole network of people and a network of relationships with particular states. The question is how does Hilary Clinton fit in this broader network? She’s a centralising cog. You’ve got a lot of different gears in operation from the big banks like Goldman Sachs and major elements of Wall Street, and Intelligence and people in the State Department and the Saudis. She’s the centraliser that inter-connects all these different cogs. She’s the smooth central representation of all that, and ‘all that’ is more or less what is in power now in the United States. It’s what we call the establishment or the DC consensus. One of the more significant Podesta emails that we released was about how the Obama cabinet was formed and how half the Obama cabinet was basically nominated by a representative from City Bank. This is quite amazing. PILGER : Didn’t Citybank supply a list… ? ASSANGE : Yes. PILGER : Which turned out to be most of the Obama cabinet? ASSANGE : Yes. PILGER : So Wall Street decides the cabinet of the President of the United States? ASSANGE : If you were following the Obama campaign back then, closely, you could see it had become very close to banking interests. So I think you can’t properly understand Hillary Clinton’s foreign policy without understanding Saudi Arabia. The connections with Saudi Arabia are so intimate. ‘Libya is Hillary Clinton’s war’ PILGER : Why was she so demonstrably enthusiastic about the destruction of Libya? Can you talk a little about just what the emails have told us – told you – about what happened there? Because Libya is such a source for so much of the mayhem now in Syria: the ISIL, jihadism, and so on. And it was almost Hillary Clinton’s invasion. What do the emails tell us about that? ASSANGE : Libya, more than anyone else’s war, was Hillary Clinton’s war. Barak Obama initially opposed it. Who was the person championing it? Hillary Clinton. That’s documented throughout her emails. She had put her favoured agent, Sidney Blumenthal, on to that; there’s more than 1700 emails out of the thirty three thousand Hillary Clinton emails that we’ve published, just about Libya. It’s not that Libya has cheap oil. She perceived the removal of Gaddafi and the overthrow of the Libyan state — something that she would use in her run-up to the general election for President. So in late 2011 there is an internal document called the Libya Tick Tock that was produced for Hillary Clinton, and it’s the chronological description of how she was the central figure in the destruction of the Libyan state, which resulted in around 40,000 deaths within Libya; jihadists moved in, ISIS moved in, leading to the European refugee and migrant crisis. Not only did you have people fleeing Libya, people fleeing Syria, the destabilisation of other African countries as a result of arms flows, but the Libyan state itself err was no longer able to control the movement of people through it. Libya faces along to the Mediterranean and had been effectively the cork in the bottle of Africa. So all problems, economic problems and civil war in Africa — previously people fleeing those problems didn’t end up in Europe because Libya policed the Mediterranean. That was said explicitly at the time, back in early 2011 by Gaddafi: ‘What do these Europeans think they’re doing, trying to bomb and destroy the Libyan State? There’s going to be floods of migrants out of Africa and jihadists into Europe, and this is exactly what happened. ‘Trump won’t be permitted to win’ PILGER : You get complaints from people saying, ‘What is WikiLeaks doing? Are they trying to put Trump in the White House?’ ASSANGE : My answer is that Trump would not be permitted to win. Why do I say that? Because he’s had every establishment off side; Trump doesn’t have one establishment, maybe with the exception of the Evangelicals, if you can call them an establishment, but banks, intelligence agencies, arms companies… big foreign money … are all united behind Hillary Clinton, and the media as well, media owners and even journalists themselves. PILGER : There is the accusation that WikiLeaks is in league with the Russians. Some people say, ‘Well, why doesn’t WikiLeaks investigate and publish emails on Russia?’ ASSANGE : We have published about 800,000 documents of various kinds that relate to Russia. Most of those are critical; and a great many books have come out of our publications about Russia, most of which are critical. Our Russia documents have gone on to be used in quite a number of court cases: refugee cases of people fleeing some kind of claimed political persecution in Russia, which they use our documents to back up. PILGER : Do you yourself take a view of the U.S. election? Do you have a preference for Clinton or Trump? ASSANGE : Let’s talk about Donald Trump. What does he represent in the American mind and in the European mind? He represents American white trash, which Hillary Clinton called ‘deplorable and irredeemable’. It means from an establishment or educated cosmopolitan, urbane perspective, these people are like the red necks, and you can never deal with them. Because he so clearly — through his words and actions and the type of people that turn up at his rallies — represents people who are not the middle, not the upper middle educated class, there is a fear of seeming to be associated in any way with them, a social fear that lowers the class status of anyone who can be accused of somehow assisting Trump in any way, including any criticism of Hillary Clinton. If you look at how the middle class gains its economic and social power, that makes absolute sense. ‘US attempting to squeeze WikiLeaks through my refugee status’ PILGER : I’d like to talk about Ecuador, the small country that has given you refuge and political asylum in this embassy in London.

C.E. Dyer reports that actor James Woods posted a powerful video on Twitter about what happened on Highway 265 in Arkansas over four decades ago that Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton doesn’t want people to know about. 
The video chronicled the rape of a 12-year-old Arkansas girl, Kathy Shelton, that occurred on May 10, 1975 when two men lured the girl into their car and brutally assaulted her. 
— James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) September 20, 2016 
This video details the horrific attack…and the actions of the attorney who defended one of the rapists: Hillary Clinton. 
According to the video, child was raped and beaten so brutally that she spent five days in a coma and was left unable to bear children. 
A local paper mill worker, 41-year-old Thomas Alfred Taylor, was charged with the rape. Then Hillary Rodham became his attorney. 
Taylor had semen mixed with the 12-year-old victim’s blood in his underwear, proving that he committed the crime. In court, Hillary maligned the rape victim’s character in order to defend her monster of a client. 
From the video: “Taylor’s attorney went to extraordinary lengths to discredit the child victim, suppressing all oral, written and physical evidence, forcing the 12-year-old to submit to polygraphs and psychiatric evaluations, even accusing the child (who had been a virgin until the attack) of seeking out older men and ‘fantasizing’ her rape.” 
The victim has recently come forward to talk about how Hillary’s lies ruined her life, which after the trial spiraled into a struggle with drugs and prison time. 
Shelton, who has already been put through a truly horrific nightmare, had to hear the tapes released in which Hillary laughed about the trial. 
Hillary laughed, on tape, about a trial of a man who brutally raped a 12-year old girl and subsequently received less than a year in prison for his horrific crime. 
Shelton has decided to speak out about her nightmare at the hands of Hillary Rodham. The video ends with a message from Shelton to Clinton, “You lied about me. You took me through Hell.” 
Clinton has claimed that she had an obligation to defend Taylor, but she is wrong; she did not have to do what she did. What she put a 12-year-old rape victim through is beyond the pale. 
Liberals regularly talk about victim blaming and rape culture in America, but where is the outrage about what Clinton did to a 12-year-old rape victim as a defense attorney? 
What else is there to say really? If you can watch that video and not be utterly and completely disgusted with Clinton, well, God help you. ","Hillary's Hypocrisy On Sexual Assault BRUTALLY Exposed | The Federalist Papers Pinterest

3250,Latino Vote Poll: Some Would Consider A Republican In 2016,"The poll from Hispanic Leadership Network and Resurgent Republic found that a majority of Latino voters in Florida, Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada prefer Democrats and a number of Democratic-supported policies, even on key Republican priorities such as bringing down the deficit and helping small business.

The results of the survey were ""sobering,"" Resurgent Republic board member Whit Ayres told reporters at a press conference Wednesday. For one, more than half of Latino voters polled in each state said the GOP doesn't respect the values and concerns of their community.

""Republicans are in a hole. There's no question Republicans are in a hole,"" he said. ""We're not sugar-coating that. But there's also no question that Republicans have enormous potential to do far better than they've done.""

The poll found that a plurality of Latino voters in each of the four states said they are more likely to vote for a Democrat than a Republican in the 2016 presidential election. But nearly a third of those voters in New Mexico and Florida said they would consider both parties, showing there is potential for the GOP to improve its standing. In Colorado and Nevada, closer to a quarter of Latino voters said they would consider both parties.

President Barack Obama won a larger proportion of the Latino vote than previous Democratic presidential candidates did in 2008 (bettering his own numbers), 2004 and 2000. One reason, according to most exit polling and the speakers on Wednesday, was former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney's harsh rhetoric and hardline stances on immigration.

""I call it the immigration earmuffs,"" Hispanic Leadership Network executive director Jennifer Korn said. ""Even though you might agree on jobs, the economy, national security, if the tone is harsh on immigration, they're not going to listen to you on the other issues.""

Another potential problem for Republicans could be social issues such as same-sex marriage, which a plurality of Latino voters said they support. It's a common trope among Republicans that Latino voters are conservatives who just don't realize it, in part because many are Catholic. But many are also younger than the average Catholic population, and their views on same-sex marriage align more with their age cohort than their religious one.

""This is where things start to get a little discomforting for me, as a Republican,"" Ayres said. ""Because these are issues on which you would expect Republicans to do relatively better. ... Democrats [considered to have] ideas that help small business. Now, come on, we are the party of small business, right? But we still haven't made that sale yet in the Hispanic community.""

Despite all the obstacles, representatives for the two groups argued there is potential for Republicans to win a larger proportion of the Latino vote, particularly those who said they consider themselves conservatives but voted Democratic anyway.

""The Republican brand among the Hispanic, Latino community is not a good brand. It's in terrible disrepair and is in need of a substantial uplift and needs substantial resuscitation. The patient's not dead, but it's on life support,"" said former Sen. Norm Coleman (R-Minn.), who is chairman of the American Action Network. ""We believe the good news is ... that there is a path to tap into the Latino community.""","Latino Vote Poll: Some Would Consider A Republican In 2016 The poll from Hispanic Leadership Network and Resurgent Republic found that a majority of Latino voters in Florida, Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada prefer Democrats and a number of Democratic-supported policies, even on key Republican priorities such as bringing down the deficit and helping small business.

817,Cruz announces Fiorina as choice for running mate,"Ted Cruz, looking for a shake-up in the 2016 race as Donald Trump moves steadily closer to the Republican nomination, on Wednesday announced former GOP primary rival Carly Fiorina as his choice for running mate should he win the party nod.

The move was immediately dismissed as an act of “desperation” by the Trump team, but Cruz – while acknowledging it is “unusual” to announce a running mate so early – defended the decision. He claimed “nobody is getting to 1,237 delegates,” the number needed to clinch the nomination, and voters should “know what [they] will get.”

“After a great deal of time and thought, after a great deal of consideration and prayer, I have come to the conclusion that if I am nominated to be president of the United States that I will run on a ticket with my vice presidential nominee, Carly Fiorina,” Cruz said.

Cruz, together now with Fiorina, was trying to fight Trump's narrative that the race is effectively ""over,"" after the front-runner swept five primary states on Tuesday. But Fiorina, in accepting Cruz's offer, said she's ready to ""fight.""

“I’ve had tough fights all my life,"" Fiorina said. ""Tough fights don’t worry me a bit.”

Cruz made the announcement in the critical primary turf of Indiana, which votes next Tuesday. Speaking at an afternoon rally in Indianapolis, Cruz announced his decision to cheers and chants of “Carly! Carly!” while touting the former HP CEO’s credentials and life story.

The theoretical pairing represents a diverse ticket – offering the possibility of electing the first Hispanic president and first female vice president.

“This is a choice that you are telling the American people that ‘This is an individual that I trust and, more important, this is an individual that you can trust to lead this country, no matter what might happen,’” Cruz said.

But for the time being, Fiorina will hold the odd position of being a vice presidential candidate-in-waiting – as Cruz continues to lag far behind Trump in the battle for the GOP nomination.

Even Fiorina would have to be elected by delegates at the convention. As for Cruz, he’s already been mathematically eliminated from clinching the nomination before the convention, and is relying on the prospect of a Cleveland floor fight.

A highly visible Cruz surrogate, the former HP CEO recently handed over her tax returns to the Cruz campaign for vetting, CNN reported Tuesday, and her name immediately surfaced when Cruz teased a “major announcement” Wednesday morning.

Cruz said Wednesday that he and his family had grown so close to Fiorina that she often sings to his young daughters -- a skill she showed off during her speech -- and also exchanges texts with the young girls.

“And Carly may be the first vice president in American history to have an impressive fluency with hearts and smiley face emoticons,"" Cruz said.



Trump leads Cruz in pledged delegates, 954-562, but Cruz’s strong ground operation has elected many delegate allies to the Republican Convention in July. Cruz believes the battle will proceed to a contested convention, where he hopes to triumph once some pledged delegates become unbound and are free to switch their votes.

Trump on Wednesday morning dismissed the notion of Cruz tapping a running mate.

""First of all, he shouldn't be naming anybody because he doesn't even have a chance,"" Trump said. ""Naming Carly's dumb, because Carly didn't do well. She had one good debate -- not against me by the way, because I had an unblemished record of victories during debates -- but she had one victory on the smaller stage and that was it.""

In a statement later Wednesday, Trump criticized the move as Cruz ""only trying to stay relevant.""

While most presidential candidates wait until they have the nomination sewn up to announce a running mate, Cruz's selection of a vice presidential candidate in April – while he’s well behind in delegates – followed a pattern of somewhat unconventional campaigning including an early embrace of Trump and kicking off his campaign without first forming an exploratory committee.

Fiorina began her career working as a secretary and receptionist but quickly rose up the business ranks and was named in 1999 as the chief executive officer for Hewlett-Packard, becoming the first woman to lead a Fortune 20 company.

""Of all the people who didn't make it far in the race, she was one of the best about laying out her plan, talking about who she is and her accomplishments,"" said Doug De Groote, a fundraiser for Cruz based near Los Angeles.

On her website, Fiorina describes her tenure at HP as having “saved 80,000 jobs” during “the worst technology recession in 25 years.” But her time at the helm also drew criticism for alleged deals with Iran brokered through a subsidiary and the laying off of 30,000 employees. In 2004, Fiorina left the company after the board of directors forced her resignation.

Her career as a political candidate began when Fiorina tried to unseat California Sen. Barbara Boxer during an unsuccessful 2010 bid. Boxer on Wednesday mocked the suggestion of Fiorina as Cruz's running mate.

""The best way to describe that ticket is mean and meaner,"" she said. ""He wants to throw people out of the country and she threw thousands of jobs out of the country. Perfect match.""

In May 2015, Fiorina announced her candidacy for president and quickly became known as a feisty critic of Hillary Clinton and a strong defender of the pro-life community. Planned Parenthood immediately panned Fiorina's Wednesday pairing with Cruz as ""the most loathsome pair of anti-abortion extremists in America.""

Her early debate performances were lauded by many critics; however, she never gained traction and suspended her campaign after single-digit finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire. She endorsed Cruz in early March and has appeared often with him on the campaign trail.

When asked about being Cruz’s vice president in early March, Fiorina replied, “Let’s win the nomination first.”

Though she eventually threw her support behind Cruz, Fiorina also attacked him when she was still a competing candidate. She termed him one of the “ultimate insiders” and called him “too divisive” in January. She also criticized Cruz for saying “one thing in the drawing rooms of Manhattan and another thing in the living rooms of Iowa.”

10210,"After terrorizing America with Zika scaremongering, Washington Post now admits Zika virus doesn’t cause brain deformities after all","March 2, 2016: Zika PAYDAY! Obama wants to funnel $1.8 billion for vaccine research and more 
I even published a mini-documentary revealing the published science that shows how DEET insecticide causes brain damage in humans. You can watch it at this link or view the video below: 
If anyone from the Washington Post bothered to read Natural News and learn about real science, they would have learned that Zika has infected tens of millions of people throughout South America for decades , with absolutely no measurable increase in neurological deformations. (But facts be damned, the WashPost had a panic to push!) Nation after nation records tens of thousands of infections with ZERO birth defects… 
Despite the factual reality of the situation, the state-controlled propagandists writing for rags like the Washington Post — a bogus newspaper that has lost all credibility in the minds of intelligent people — continued to pummel home their kooky science theories that claimed much of the U.S. South would be overrun by brain damaging mosquitoes, turning Southerners into shrunken-brained mutants while pregnant women fled northward to survive the airborne insect onslaught. 
Instead, nothing happened . No explosion in shrunken-headed babies. No wave of birth defects across Florida, even as city officials desperately bombarded their own cities with brain-damaging insecticides. No national emergency declared by Obama to bring back DDT and eradicate baby-murdering mosquitoes by dousing our open streets with thick clouds of organophosphate neurotoxins. 
Instead, the rate of neurological birth defects in most countries approached zero. Via the Washington Post’s own graphic: (partial list) 
Venezuela: 60,791 Zika infections… ZERO birth defects Honduras: 31,933 Zika infections… ONE birth defect Guadalupe: 30,969 Zika infections… ZERO birth defects Puerto Rico: 29,084 Zika infections… TWO birth defects Mexico: 4,837 Zika infections… ZERO birth defects 
From the WashPost article: 
Brazilian officials were bracing for a flood of fetal deformities as Zika spread this year to other regions of the country, Marinho said. However, “we are not seeing a big increase.” 
Gee, really? 
The vast majority of the brain defects, it turns out, came from just one small region of Brazil. A total of 2,033 children are so far recorded with neurological defects there, even while most other countries throughout the region had ZERO birth defects (or near zero). 
So what gives? Zika mosquitoes apparently carry geopolitical maps so they can solely target Brazil 
You don’t have to be a genius to figure out that the stupid science theories of the mainstream media are total hokum and bunk . If Zika really did cause brain defects, it would have spread all across South America by now. It would have spread into Florida, California, Mississippi and Louisiana. It would have devastated the American South, Cuba, Haiti, Curacao and all the other island nations across the Caribbean. 
Yet the neurological defects were limited almost exclusively to Brazil. 
Somehow, if we believe the illiterate Washington Post science writers — who may in fact be the only brain damage victims of Zika in North America — mosquitoes carry MAPS to make sure they only activate their brain damage voodoo in Brazil . 
“…[A]lthough the outbreak has spread this year to more than 50 nations and territories across the Western Hemisphere, U.N. data shows just 142 cases of congenital birth defects linked to Zika so far outside Brazil,” says WashPost. 
Yes, my friends: GPA-carrying Zika mosquitoes are very careful to limit their pandemic voodoo to just one region of Brazil. By sheer coincidence, that’s the same region where larvacide chemicals were dumped into the public water supply. 
Apparently, there isn’t a single “official” scientist in the entire global government who has thought to test the water. Just freaking WOW… Let’s throw these morons out of power in every election, okay? They don’t deserve any positions of authority over anyone else. They’re all so incredibly stupid, they couldn’t survive at all unless they functioned as parasites on the taxpayers. They aren’t giving up hope just yet… science writers desperately hope for more brain damaged babies to prove them right 
Enthusiasm for more brain damaged babies runs high at the Washington Post, which explains why they are all in for Hillary Clinton, the candidate of choice for brain damaged adults . Writing with a sense of real enthusiasm, the Washington Post can’t wait for more brain damaged babies to appear: 
Scientists at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are closely watching Puerto Rico, which has reported more than 26,800 cases of Zika. More than 7,000 pregnant women could be infected by the end of the year, according to the CDC. (Yippee?) 
And now, the loony tunes quack science of the Zika “scientists” goes apoplectic, grasping for silly metaphors to try to obscure the fact that they are all stupid beyond belief . Via the WashPost: 
“Now we’ve settled on Zika as the smoking gun, but we don’t know who pulled the trigger,” said Marques, speaking from Recife, where he is working with government researchers. 
Huh? Wha? The metaphor doesn’t even make any sense. 
Maybe the problem is too much fornicating. Seriously, this is now part of their idiotic theory: 
“Sexual habits and hygiene may also play a role,” he said, explaining that researchers are looking at whether sexual transmission can infect the uterus and placenta with the virus, potentially exposing the fetus to elevated risk. “We suspect the villain has an accomplice, but we don’t know who it is,” Marques said. 
Huh? Do they seriously think that people only have sex in Brazil but not other South American countries? Where does the Washington Post find these morons? I’m a real scientist saying all this 
As you read all this, remember that I have rapidly become one of the world’s leading research scientists on the quantitation of cannabinoids in hemp extracts using mass spec instrumentation. I led the team that developed the most pioneering (and accurate) CBD mass spec analysis method in existence today. You can read about it at this link . I also routinely test water, food and environmental samples for heavy metals, pesticides and a multitude of chemical contaminants. When I say these Zika scientists are complete morons, that’s the educated opinion of an accomplished scientist correctly pointing out the lunacy of Zika scaremongering. 
I could have solved this entire problem in the first few days by analyzing and detecting brain-damaging larvacide chemicals in the public water supply in Eastern Brazil. The entire project would have taken just a few days and cost almost nothing. Instead, Obama handed $1.8 billion to the vaccine companies in the midst of the Zika panic pushed by laughable rags like the Washington Post. It’s all a racket, of course, just like their coverage of elections and political candidates. Everything you read at the Washington Post is a deception of one kind or another . The paper exists solely to promote the propaganda of the state so that the population can be manipulated and controlled. The Washington Post exists to terrorize the citizens with fascist propaganda parading as science 
As you’ve also learned by now, the corrupt leftist establishment of junk science, criminal politicians and idiotic journalists isn’t interested in legitimate scientific solutions . They all function as extensions of a fascist state that must routinely terrorize its citizens with pandemic boogeyman scare stories in order to demand absolute obedience to the vaccine mandates that actually do damage the brains of children. 
Thus, SCIENCE be damned. They’ve got an agenda to push, and it doesn’t matter to them whether that agenda is based on a single shred of real science. Zika is dangerous because they told you so, in exactly the same way they told you Hillary Clinton is totally honest, Obamacare would make health care more affordable, there’s no such thing as voter fraud in America, and GMOs and vaccines are really, really good for you. 
So you can put down the DEET and stop poisoning your skin like an obedient idiot. Yes, it was all a scam. Yes, the official “science” was totally rigged. Yes, the media lied to you yet again. Yes, the CDC is a criminal racket. Yes, all the health “officials” were completely full of s**t. And no, Zika is not going to cause your babies to be born with shrunken heads. VACCINES, on the other hand, will most definitely cause brain damage, as they still contain mercury, a potent neurotoxin the Washington Post ridiculously insists becomes magically neutralized when you inject it into the body of a child.","After terrorizing America with Zika scaremongering, Washington Post now admits Zika virus doesn’t cause brain deformities after all March 2, 2016: Zika PAYDAY!

4720,Do voters care about more Trump tapes?,"Some say additional tapes of Republican nominee Donald Trump making disparaging, sexual comments likely exist, but it’s unclear if such revelations could impact the candidate’s loyal voting base.

Supporters of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump gather at Trump Tower on Saturday, in New York. Mr. Trump insisted he would 'never' abandon his White House bid, despite calls for him to quit the race following the release of his sexually charged comments caught on tape.

Those who worked alongside Donald Trump say there are likely unheard records of lewd, disgraceful statements made by the candidate, but the impact such recordings could have on his candidacy may be limited.

Mr. Trump’s colorful, and often controversial, comments have characterized his campaign. He has made offensive remarks regarding Muslims, immigrants, the African-American community, women, and prisoners of war, many of which have led establishment Republicans to turn their backs on the GOP nominee. But his “tell it like it is” attitude has also resonated with groups of disenchanted voters, imploring them to put their trust in Trump and defend, or ignore, his alienating remarks.

The greatest crisis of Trump’s political career to date came Friday when The Washington Post released a lewd tape from 2005. In the recording, Trump makes disparaging comments about his sexual conduct with women. Top Republicans, including Arizona Sen. John McCain and Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, took a firm stance against their party’s candidate, saying they could no longer plan to support him. Many urged him to step down and cede the platform to vice presidential candidate Mike Pence.

Those who know the candidate paint vastly different pictures of him. Some have said he was professional during his tenure on the NBC reality series “The Apprentice,” but, Bill Pruitt, a former producer on the reality show, alluded to the possibility of more, and worse, recordings from the show in a tweet Saturday.

“As a producer on seasons 1 & 2 of #theapprentice I assure you: when it comes to the #trumptapes there are far worse. #justthebegininng,” he wrote.

Since, the real estate mogul’s opponents have been eager to uncover the recordings, hoping more damning comments could bury the Republican’s campaign.

But it’s not clear what effect, if any, more controversial tapes would have on Trump’s run for president. His supporters haven’t been easily swayed by the kind of scandals that have ruined presidential bids in years past. After Friday's release the tape, 74 percent of Republicans said GOP leaders should continue to support the candidate, and only 12 percent of Republicans said they’d like to see Trump end his bid for president, according to a Morning Consult/Politico poll conducted immediately after The Washington Post broke the news about the 11-year-old video.

“The results show that nearly all voters have heard about the video and most rate it negatively, but Trump’s supporters are not abandoning him right away,” Kyle Dropp, co-founder and chief research officer at Morning Consult, which conducted the poll along with Politico, said.

While some of these voters are drawn to Trump’s bold statements and aggressive temperament, others see the choice in this election as hinging on policy, not personality. As The Christian Science Monitor previously reported, evangelical Christians have surprisingly stood by the candidate, citing his stance on topics like abortion, religious freedom, economic policies, and Supreme Court justice ideologies.

This behavior, while counterintuitive at first glance, isn’t new in the world of partisan politics.

“Without overstating the case, [evangelicals’ defense of Trump] does remind me of when a lot of prominent feminists came to the defense of President Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky matter,” John Green, a religion and politics expert at the University of Akron, in Ohio, told the Monitor. “They said, ‘We deplore the conduct, but look at all the positive things the Clinton administration has done for women.’ ”

With less than a month until election day, pledged Trump supporters may be unlikely to shift their allegiances, even if more material drawing the candidate’s character into question arises. And Trump himself seems to recognize the power of his loyal voting bloc.

“The polls, they say I have the most loyal people, did you ever see that? Where I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn’t lose any votes, okay?” Trump said in January. “It’s like incredible.”","Do voters care about more Trump tapes?

9042,The Set-Up For Gold & Silver: CARNAGE in the Bond Market Pre-Cursor to Market Crash? | Eric Sprott,"October 28, 2016 at 11:28 AM 
Reflecting on the WMD called ZIRP, I conclude that ZIRP is the best evidence of the “New World (dis)Order WORL” weapon of mass destruction in which we’ve lived for the last 8 years. This represents the equivalent of having no sheriff in town. 
A simple Occam’s Razor view of ZIRP clearly shows interest rates are the equivalent of a sheriff making sure we adhere to the Constitution, both a document that helps insure that monetary rules are followed while being protected against undue harm via the Sheriff’s color of authority. 
When rates reflect reality we have a monetary Sheriff watching over our fiscal safety. When rates are zero we see a total absence of law in the world. 
Interest rates are the monetary rule makers and law enforcement that drive the reality of risk and reward. If a person, company or country follows the rule and obeys the normal laws of economics, finance and investment and adheres to some reasonable variant of Say’s Law, they are rewarded with reasonable rates that helps them create value,wealth and worth by accessing some form of debt that aids in that growth. The investor is rewarded with a return commensurate with risk. If the same entity runs rampant, disregarding the restraints of interest on their investments, they are called to account and forced to pay for their transgressions. 
When ZIRP drives out the rule of law; the equivalent of the interest rate Sheriff being driven out of town; put out to pasture, the potential for high crimes and misdemeanors ramps upward exponentially. Is it an accident that we have seen the ascension of crime family actions that now brings us to ZIRP and its attendant insanity. The last 60 years has seen the constant unrelenting actions against real money and the reality of interest rates as one of the strongest arbiters the world of finance. ZIRP has replaced the rule of law. 
Is it an accident that we see the criminal rentier class rolling in with heavy weapons, tanks and bombs, whether in a hard kinetic form that destroys entire countries, cities and neighborhoods (banks now have their own armies) or rolling in with their interest rate WDMs? 
This ultra wealthy rentier class strip mines the little wealth remaining in the hands of We, the People with hard force, demented interpretations and variations of good Constitutional law or simply no law except that which they create on the fly, with the aid of a DOJ and FBI complicit i these crimes ( reference our criminal justice system). 
The penumbra of destruction that weighs against the rule of law extends to politics, from the lowest to the highest levels and begets the likes of the Clinton, Bush and Obama Kriminal Klans; AJs like Lorretta Lynch and Holder and bankers like Bernanke, Yellen, Draghi, Blankfein and Dimon, all of whom go on to form new age oligarchies that steal from the people with not a single substantive charge levied or day spend in prison. 
The system is rigged. There is no justice. There’s Just Us. 
None of these people suffers the consequences of their predations because they not only have unlimited access to interest free capital, they own the banks that provide them with tens of trillions in capital with which to engage in war against us. They own the armies to hold us in bond and bondage if we raise a challenge to their rapacity and theft of our substance 
If they win a bet against us they make billions or trillions. If they lose a bet against us, we, the tax payers, are forced to make up the losses. Their capital has no cost. Their losses are never charged against the house. Unless it’s your house and you’re forced to move or are thrown out by some variation of their army or Praetorian guard. 
I’m guessing that these financial rapists will never stop because there is never enough for them. Pitchforks, torches, molotovs and the weight of humanity pressed against our oppressors will win the day and it will take some serious sacrafices and lives to win against these new age feudalists 
On a lighter and better side, the Oregon jury acquitted Aamon Bundy and his friends of all charges. Count one in the win column for the good guys. Now we need to see Cliven Bundy freed from his bondage.","The Set-Up For Gold & Silver: CARNAGE in the Bond Market Pre-Cursor to Market Crash? | Eric Sprott October 28, 2016 at 11:28 AM

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has a few problems when it comes to Black voters. To look at the polls, you’d wonder if there is a single Black person in the entire country who is willing to give him the time of the day. They do show up, of course. Sure, sometimes they turn out to be ex-cult members turned jazz singing GOP fanatics . Sure, sometimes they are faded celebrities who accidentally use the ‘N’ word on stage. But you know, sometimes it’s a Marine or Navy serviceman who has somehow managed to look past the debase insults , juvenile tantrums , and transparent lies of the GOP’s great orange hope. 
It’s such a damn shame that Trump can’t tell one group from another. They All Look The Same To Trump 
His recent attempts at rebooting his campaign’s standing with Black people was something of a fiasco . It failed in part because it’s way too late for Trump to distance himself from close ties to White supremacy and antisemitism . 
But it also failed because his image of the lives of Black people is that it is one of nasty, brutish, Dickensian squalor. Indeed, it’s so out of touch-offensive that even his plans to help struggling Black communities come across as being unforgivably racist. 
It’s little wonder, then, that when Trump saw a black face at his rally in Kinston, North Carolina, his razor-sharp mind kicked in. He jumped to the kind of conclusion you’d expect from a man with less racial sensitivity than a 19th century British naval officer. 
He assumed the man was a protester. Different Strokes Of The Pen 
Sixty-three-year-old ex-Marine C.J. Cary was on a mission. Though a die-hard Republican, he had been deeply shocked by some of the things Trump has said. In an effort to reason with him, he penned a letter that, according to the Charlette Observer : “… [Urged] Trump to be less offensive and more inclusive to four demographic groups: black people, women, people with disabilities and college students.” 
He never got to deliver the note. 
He made his way toward the front rows shouting “Donald” and waving his document, trying to attract the nominees attention. It worked. Sort of. “We have a protester!” Trump told the crowd, adding : “By the way,were you paid $1,500 to be a thug?” Trump calls black supporter a ""thug,"" has him kicked out of a rally in North Carolina. https://t.co/b4gkI6qx9v pic.twitter.com/eJKuu0CLRi

As the long time Republican voter was escorted from the venue he made one final attempt to get his note to the man who would be king : “I said, ‘I was trying to get to this doc to Mr. Donald … will you get this to Donald?’” 
The official promised he would pass along the note. Having been treated to some common courtesy at last, Cary set off back home to watch the election coverage with that same horrified expression that we’ve all become so accustomed to. 
By the way, this wasn’t the first time a Trump supporter has been mistaken for a protester simply because he wasn’t the right color:

The National Unity Day, first celebrated on 4 November 2005, commemorates the popular uprising lead by prince Dmitry Pozharsky and a meat merchant Kuzma Minin which ejected the alien occupying forces of Polish Roman Papists army from Moscow in November 1612, and more generally the end of the Time of Troubles and foreign interventions in Russia. Its name alludes to the idea that all the classes of the Russian society willingly united to preserve the Russian statehood when its demise seemed inevitable, even though there was neither Tsar nor Patriarch to guide them.

Russia: Putin and Patriarch Kirill bless new monument to Vladimir the Great 

Nov 4, 2016 
President Vladimir Putin unveiled a new monument to the Russia’s first Christian leader Vladimir the Great in Moscow, on Friday. The opening ceremony took place just in few meters from Kremlin walls and coincided with the Russian National Unity Day. 
Vladimir Putin, Russian President (Russian): “Your Holiness. Respected Muscovites! Dear friends! I greet and congratulate you on the opening of the monument to Saint Equal-to-apostles Prince Vladimir. This is a big and significant event for Moscow, for the whole country and for all Russian compatriots. It is symbolic that it is being held on the National Unity Day here in the centre of the capital near the walls of the ancient Kremlin, in the heart of Russia.” 
Vladimir Putin, Russian President (Russian): “The strong moral support, cohesion and unity helped our ancestors to overcome difficulties, to live and to win for the glory of the Fatherland, to strengthen its power and greatness from generation to generation. And today it is our duty to stand together against modern threats and challenges basing on spiritual precepts, invaluable traditions of unity and concord and to move forward ensuring the continuity of our thousand-year history.” 
Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and all Russia (Russian): “The monument to Prince Vladimir is a symbol of the unity of all the peoples to whom he is farther. This is the peoples of the historical Rus’ currently living within the borders of many states. The monument to the farther may be everywhere where his children live. There is no contradiction in it. But it is bad if children forget that they have the only father.” The Essential Saker: from the trenches of the emerging multipolar world $27.95 Be the First to Comment!

But it is bad if children forget that they have the only father.” The Essential Saker: from the trenches of the emerging multipolar world $27.95 Be the First to Comment!

The increasing symbiosis between the political and the leading mainstream media of the Western world implies that, grosso modo, Russia is blamed for having caused this new situation. While Russia is certainly not innocent and it usually does take two to conflict this blame is rather a sign of diminishing capacity (knowledge) and will (economic and intellectual independence and courage) to ask critical questions that now characterise the corporate media. 
Defence and security political news coverage, journalistic processing, editing and commentaries have sunk to an intellectual level that is considerably lower than during the first Cold War. The entire field is given low priority by editors. Domestic issues, sports, entertainment, lifestyle etc. have made it to the top. 
Out of sync with the globalising world, most media do with 1-2 pages about global affairs out of, say, 40-50 pages and they base this material on the same handful of Western news bureaus. 
The double checking of a variety of sources, versatility and multi-perspective coverage are things of the past and we see more uniformity and more subjectivity in the news media coverage than ever. 
Add to this that both Russia and NATO countries engage in media management, or propaganda (tax payers footing the bills) which squeezes out comprehensive knowledge and unbiased analyses as well as critical angles on one’s own policies and actions. 
Like hot wars, Cold Wars are fought not only on the battle fields but also in the media, about the souls of the citizens. Fearology, therefore, has become a dominant ingredient in this war as well as in the other – equally counterproductive and self-defeating – war, the War On Terror. 
The more people are made to fear, the more they submit to surveillance, authoritarian laws, self-censorship etc and turn away from democratic debate and activism – a trend that will eventually lead to the dissolution of democracy itself. 
In short, these international trends and tension-increasing confrontations boomerang back on our societies in ways that are as frightening as under-stated in the debate. 
To put it crudely: the new Cold War and the War on Terror both have significant, destructive effects on society, diminish its democracy and creativity, narrows the spectrum of opinions and bring us further and further away from the globally desired goals of freedom, democracy and of living in a more peaceful world. 
Security politics has come to mean destruction of the core fibres of what was to be secured. Paradoxically, it promotes the closing of the once open society. 
In addition, that is, to squandering absurd US $ 1700 billion (or about 30 times the entire UN budget) worldwide on one more destructive, failed war after the other. 
These are issues of the greatest importance for humanity’s future, even survival.","Security Politics and the Closing of the Open Society Email

6110,"Clinton “Fixer”: I Spiked Damaging Stories for Sexually Depraved, Morally Corrupt Hillary","Email 
Clinton wins “by a landslide” — in the corruption department. So says columnist, New York Times bestselling author, and admitted Clinton “bagman” Jeff Rovin. Initially presenting his story anonymously in the National Enquirer , Rovin subsequently revealed his identity in a Monday interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity. Among his striking claims: The Clintons have an “open marriage,” Hillary has had affairs with both men and women, and he paid off reporters to keep the copious Clinton dirt hush-hush. And these allegations are backed up by 24-years' worth of documentation. 
Rovin’s appearance on Hannity (video below) adds further weight to his claims, as people often associate the Enquirer with fanciful tales. Yet as Hannity himself pointed out, that paper has at times broken major stories, catching the rest of the media napping. Hannity cited scoops concerning O.J. Simpson, John Edwards’ mistress, Gary Hart, Jesse Jackson’s out-of-wedlock child, Tiger Woods’ marriage woes, and others. In fact, Rovin said that such Enquirer stories are, ironically, “probably better vetted than most of the stories in other media” because they’re “so controversial.” 
Of course, the Enquirer 's scoops almost invariably involve salacious matters, and the Clinton story is no exception. Yet most significant are Rovin’s disclosures about media suppression of truth — and efforts to destroy people such as Monica Lewinsky. 
Rovin explains that as a Hollywood reporter in the '80s and '90s, his close relationship with the Tinseltown power set and press allowed him to become, as he put it, “‘a fixer’: someone who helps stars keep embarrassing stories out of the press.” Rovin did his job so well that in 1991 he was asked to work for a rising political couple who, together, were an embarrassing-story-disgorging machine: Arkansas governor William Jefferson Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham. As he wrote : I was informed that these stories would involve rumors of Bill Clinton' s many sexual dalliances and an alleged ongoing affair of Hillary Clinton with a male member of her law firm, Vince Foster, as well as a female mover-and-shaker in Hollywood. For a retainer of $4,000 a month — paid by a third party, not the campaign — I was told to keep these stories hush-hush in one of two ways: by trading access to the Clintons for “positive” interviews, or by paying the reporters. The payments were always cash, usually delivered in a movie theater or restaurant on Sunset Boulevard, and came in two denominations: $100 for a heads-up that a bad story was coming; or considerably more to kill the piece. 
Rovin’s claims align perfectly with the recent WikiLeaks revelations about direct collusion between the corrupt mainstream media and Clinton campaign; among the examples are a New York Times reporter giving the campaign veto power over quotations, a CNBC reporter advising the campaign, and CNN commentator Donna Brazile forwarding Clinton a debate question prior to a March face-off against Bernie Sanders (yes, Sandernistas, the fix was really in). 
Yet bribery wasn’t the only method for getting stories spiked; deception was another. As Rovin told Hannity, reporters “were paid to soften the stories.… What would happen is, if we got wind of a story from the tabloids, chances were pretty good it would end up in one of the mainstream newspapers or magazines. We would then contact one of those people and say, ‘This isn't true, don't run it.’” 
And this apparently does ring true to Hannity, who spoke of the evidence he saw, saying to Rovin, “I went through with your editor everything that you had. You do have ledgers; you did have the faxes with the letterhead and the timestamps. The Clintons know you…. They know you fixed things for them.” 
And Rovin says this fixing became a full-time job, as the Clintons committed continual sexual indiscretions in what he described as a “polyamorous” and “open” marriage — which matches the “open borders” Hillary said, in an e-mail, that she wanted. 
Rovin appears to believe the Clintons’ sexual depravity was so all-consuming that it distracted Bill from the business of running the country. He cites as the worst example of judgment the bachelor party in March 1994 for Clinton’s half-brother, Roger Clinton, who, in quintessential Clinton style, was marrying a bride eight-months-pregnant. Prostitutes were present, and recordings were made — they included Bill Clinton. 
None of this will surprise those who know of Bill’s having taken 26 flights on billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein’s “Lolita Express,” but the recording was a problem: It was offered for sale to the Enquirer , says Rovin. This is when he says he swooped in and negotiated a deal to keep the recording suppressed. (Note: This would be a national-security concern, too. A foreign power that obtained such a recording conceivably could use it to blackmail the president.) 
Also in 1994, Rovin “arranged a meeting for Hillary and a woman in an exclusive Beverly Hills hotel,” he said . “I helped her slip out of a back exit for a one-on-one session with the other woman.” The journalist described this encounter as “sordid.” 
Rovin also reveals that he was part of a “team effort” to damage Monica Lewinsky; in fact, Rovin later felt so bad about this smear campaign that he apologized to Lewinsky personally. In addition, the journalist “told Hannity he was tasked with distracting the media while Hillary’s crew rummaged through [Vince] Foster’s office … to snatch documents related to the Whitewater scandal,” as WND.com put it . 
As to Rovin’s motivations for finally coming forward, he mentioned two significant factors. He told Hannity that when he learned that Enquirer editor Dylan Howard was doing the Clinton story and was naming sources he wanted kept confidential, he agreed to participate under the condition he could protect those sources. Second, he wrote in the Enquirer piece, “I am coming forward now because of the endless attention the alleged indiscretions of Donald Trump have received. Nothing I have heard comes close to the sexual and moral corruption of the Clintons — many of which have [sic] yet to be revealed.” 
Having said this, Rovin was dismayed at the campaign emphasis on dirt, saying to Hannity, “The election is too important to focus on this salacious material.” Identifying as a libertarian, the journalist expressed the common idea that politicians’ sexual indiscretions are none of anyone’s business and should be beyond scrutiny. And while many issues are more important — such as Clinton’s internationalist, open-borders dreams; amnesty plans; warmongering stance vis-à-vis Russia; and radical social agenda — that common idea is also a mistaken idea. 
Question: Is there any sexual indiscretion a politician could commit that would bring his psychological fitness into question? What if a person habitually engages in bestiality? Would you want such an individual managing your finances or babysitting your child? If not, why not, if “private” sexual behavior has no bearing on whether the person can “do the job”? 
If so, however, then would you want such a person’s finger on the nuclear button? 
Now, what kind of sexual depravity is not a red flag? 
During the Bill Clinton years, “Character doesn’t matter” became a meme used to justify Clinton corruption. But would you want to be pulled over by a cop with bad character or have your car repaired by a mechanic with same? Character is integral to everything we do . 
The Bible speaks of “eyes blinded by sin,” “For the eye altering alters all,” wrote poet William Blake. Habitually engaging in wrongdoing and (as man will do) rationalizing it away — which is when we deny reality — causes us to lose touch with reality. Twisting the truth in our own minds twists our minds; conning ourselves corrupts our judgment. The eye altering…

8916,The Next Big Shoe to Drop,"The Next Big Shoe to Drop Posted on   The Next Big Shoe to Drop 
This is yet another source of highly flammable fuel that will result in more gasoline when the Fed is called in… 

From Dr. Jeffrey Lewis : 
More than 40 million young Americans carry federal and private student loan debt – amounting to over $1 trillion. Defaults are on the rise and the issue has grown to become a nasty wealth transfer mechanism, as well as sad example of the failure of finance in general. 
This week, President Obama announced a new initiative framed as a way of addressing the issue. Sadly, it is far from the mark, and just one more indication that monetary masters are the real puppeteers. 
Many have pointed out that the student loan debt bubble could be the next subprime crisis. 
Perhaps so, but it is potentially much worse, acting as an anvil when considered in the context of other consumer debt like car loans and credit cards. 
The student debt debacle has the potential of corrupting not only education, but a generation as well. 
It risks becoming the blight on a generation of would-be productive and innovative work force. 
Furthermore, the workforce declines, and falls behind, as more students return home to live with parents. And the extra burden on multi-generational households adds yet another deflationary force to the natural trend. 
From the perspective of bankers, policy makers, and the propaganda machine, college loan programs have been a tremendous success, providing access for students who would otherwise not be able to afford the privilege. 
It is about threading a narrow political path. 
Defaults are on the rise and the notional value of student loans went north of $1 trillion. 
Servicers must be getting nervous; the lobbyists are circling the wagons. 
There is no clear indication of who will pay for it – or how. 
Defaults on the rise; one in seven currently default. 
The news of doing something comes around to yet another intervention with all the familiar signs that it is meant to save the financiers and has very little to do with helping students. 
The problem is that this is too little too late. 
Student loan debt is a trillion dollar reality in the context of a major, ongoing depression. 
We are a Nanny state – with almost 50 million on food stamps and more on some sort of assistance. Labor force participation is at 40 year lows. 
There is already a major dis-incentive to work. If you take a horrible minimum wage job, you lose valuable benefits, entitlements. 
Which, incidentally, also explains why while it took the U.S. economy 6 years to recover all the job losses since Lehman. This took place at the expense of 13 million Americans leaving the labor force for good even as the U.S. population rose by 15 million. 
It also means that using a historical average participation rate, U.S. unemployment is over 11%, while underemployment is currently well in the 20% range – a far more realistic assessment of where the U.S. economy really is. 
People on assistance programs are literally paid to stay home – think of the cultural implications. 
It’s almost a conspiracy. You have a massive class of under the table people with no voice. Give them bread and circuses. 
The student loan debacle is another story. 
For the parents, the typical situation is framed by skyrocketing tuition; and little help from scholarships become fractions in the face of rising tuition. 
The income cut-off for need-based financial aid is low. 
Parents are expected to contribute 25% of pre-tax income to the cost of tuition. 
If you earn $80K a year and your child’s college tuition is $20K, you get nothing in terms of need-based financial aid. And that 25% doesn’t count room & board, books, etc. 
So, it’s basically impossible for middle-class families to send their kids to college without taking out student loans. In fact, the entire higher-education system is built to force people into debt if they want to send their kids to college. 
And it has a sinister underlying theme… 
It’s always about the “irresponsible student” or the “hairdresser subprime loan borrower” who “should have known better”. 
They should have known that housing prices eventually fall, even though “everyone” in the mainstream, including the chairman of the Federal Reserve said they would not. They should have read carefully the fine print instead of trusting the fancy loan officer. 
And everyone knows that without a college education you will not succeed, so “borrow whatever it takes”. You’ll pay it back. 
Two decades of further tweaks to the bankruptcy code ensued until 2005, when Congress passed the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. This Act made it so that no student loan — federal or private — could be discharged in bankruptcy unless the borrower can prove repaying the loan would cause “undue hardship,” a condition that is incredibly difficult to demonstrate unless the person has a severe disability. It essentially lumps student loan debt in with child support and criminal fines — other types of debt that can’t be discharged. 
But our system is perfectly fine going after the invisible – those without a political voice – whether the poor or elderly who get crushed by inflation, or the 18 year olds who get out with $100K in debt and an art appreciation degree. 
But the price of education should tell an even deeper story…. 
Quality of Education Suffers 
The compounding irony is that not only does the price of education go up, but the quality goes down. Institutions become entrenched. There is little incentive evolve, tenure runs rampant. And the curriculum declines. 
Higher education becomes both a commodity and a spectacle. Not a vehicle for progress or a reflection of the needs of the culture or the economy. 
That may not be hyperinflation…but it’s very sad. College education quality has not risen proportionately with price. 
Student loan debt is out of control by any and all measures. It’s a debacle that benefits no one besides the banker and the servicers. The schools lose by making themselves unviable in the long run. 
The students come away with non-dischargeable student loans and enter a world without, for the most part, having any marketable skills. 
Sadly, the student loans are just one more politically untouchable issue providing yet another source of highly flammable fuel that will result in more gasoline when the Fed is called in.","The Next Big Shoe to Drop The Next Big Shoe to Drop Posted on   The Next Big Shoe to Drop

This week, President Obama announced a new initiative framed as a way of addressing the issue. Sadly, it is far from the mark, and just one more indication that monetary masters are the real puppeteers. 
Many have pointed out that the student loan debt bubble could be the next subprime crisis. 
Perhaps so, but it is potentially much worse, acting as an anvil when considered in the context of other consumer debt like car loans and credit cards. 
The student debt debacle has the potential of corrupting not only education, but a generation as well. 
It risks becoming the blight on a generation of would-be productive and innovative work force. 
Furthermore, the workforce declines, and falls behind, as more students return home to live with parents. And the extra burden on multi-generational households adds yet another deflationary force to the natural trend. 
From the perspective of bankers, policy makers, and the propaganda machine, college loan programs have been a tremendous success, providing access for students who would otherwise not be able to afford the privilege. 
It is about threading a narrow political path. 
Defaults are on the rise and the notional value of student loans went north of $1 trillion. 
Servicers must be getting nervous; the lobbyists are circling the wagons. 
There is no clear indication of who will pay for it – or how. 
Defaults on the rise; one in seven currently default. 
The news of doing something comes around to yet another intervention with all the familiar signs that it is meant to save the financiers and has very little to do with helping students. 
The problem is that this is too little too late. 
Student loan debt is a trillion dollar reality in the context of a major, ongoing depression. 
We are a Nanny state – with almost 50 million on food stamps and more on some sort of assistance. Labor force participation is at 40 year lows. 
There is already a major dis-incentive to work. If you take a horrible minimum wage job, you lose valuable benefits, entitlements. 
Which, incidentally, also explains why while it took the U.S. economy 6 years to recover all the job losses since Lehman. This took place at the expense of 13 million Americans leaving the labor force for good even as the U.S. population rose by 15 million. 
It also means that using a historical average participation rate, U.S. unemployment is over 11%, while underemployment is currently well in the 20% range – a far more realistic assessment of where the U.S. economy really is. 
People on assistance programs are literally paid to stay home – think of the cultural implications. 
It’s almost a conspiracy. You have a massive class of under the table people with no voice. Give them bread and circuses. 
The student loan debacle is another story. 
For the parents, the typical situation is framed by skyrocketing tuition; and little help from scholarships become fractions in the face of rising tuition. 
The income cut-off for need-based financial aid is low. 
Parents are expected to contribute 25% of pre-tax income to the cost of tuition. 
If you earn $80K a year and your child’s college tuition is $20K, you get nothing in terms of need-based financial aid. And that 25% doesn’t count room & board, books, etc. 
So, it’s basically impossible for middle-class families to send their kids to college without taking out student loans. In fact, the entire higher-education system is built to force people into debt if they want to send their kids to college. 
And it has a sinister underlying theme… 
It’s always about the “irresponsible student” or the “hairdresser subprime loan borrower” who “should have known better”. 
They should have known that housing prices eventually fall, even though “everyone” in the mainstream, including the chairman of the Federal Reserve said they would not. They should have read carefully the fine print instead of trusting the fancy loan officer. 
And everyone knows that without a college education you will not succeed, so “borrow whatever it takes”. You’ll pay it back. 
Two decades of further tweaks to the bankruptcy code ensued until 2005, when Congress passed the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. This Act made it so that no student loan — federal or private — could be discharged in bankruptcy unless the borrower can prove repaying the loan would cause “undue hardship,” a condition that is incredibly difficult to demonstrate unless the person has a severe disability. It essentially lumps student loan debt in with child support and criminal fines — other types of debt that can’t be discharged. 
But our system is perfectly fine going after the invisible – those without a political voice – whether the poor or elderly who get crushed by inflation, or the 18 year olds who get out with $100K in debt and an art appreciation degree. 
But the price of education should tell an even deeper story…. 
Quality of Education Suffers 
The compounding irony is that not only does the price of education go up, but the quality goes down. Institutions become entrenched. There is little incentive evolve, tenure runs rampant. And the curriculum declines. 
Higher education becomes both a commodity and a spectacle. Not a vehicle for progress or a reflection of the needs of the culture or the economy. 
That may not be hyperinflation…but it’s very sad. College education quality has not risen proportionately with price. 
Student loan debt is out of control by any and all measures. It’s a debacle that benefits no one besides the banker and the servicers. The schools lose by making themselves unviable in the long run. 
The students come away with non-dischargeable student loans and enter a world without, for the most part, having any marketable skills. 
Sadly, the student loans are just one more politically untouchable issue providing yet another source of highly flammable fuel that will result in more gasoline when the Fed is called in.","next big shoe drop next big shoe drop post next big shoe drop

6412,A Measure of Fascism in America,"By wmw_admin on October 27, 2016 by Marcus Aurealeus, Facebook Note — OffGuardian.org Oct 27, 2016 
T he word “fascism” is generally used today as a pejorative to attack any idea that a speaker happens to dislike. But this word has a specific meaning and a specific historical context. It refers to an authoritarian, nationalistic system of government and social organization that is usually considered to be far right-wing. Historically, it was most popular in the 1930s, when the regimes of Hitler, Mussolini, and Franco were in their primes. Later examples include Indonesia under Suharto, Bolivia under Banzer, and Chile under Pinochet. In practice, fascism combines the ideas of collectivism, mercantilism, nationalism, (statist) syndicalism, and uniculturalism into a system where business leaders and political rulers work together to create public policies that benefit themselves at the expense of everyone else. 
To what extent is the United States of America in 2015 a fascist nation? In order to determine this, a means of measurement is needed. Lawrence Britt has studied fascist regimes and found that there are 14 characteristics which all of them have in common to some degree. Matthew Reece goes further and examines these characteristics and assigns each of them a value on a ten-point scale, with zero being completely absent and 10 being omnipresent. Let us also see how many are trending upward, trending downward, and holding steady. The final score on a 140-point scale will give a useful measure of the degree of fascism in America. Powerful and Continuing Nationalism – Fascists tend to make constant use of patriotic mottoes, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays. 
In America, patriotic mottoes, slogans, symbols, songs, and flags have been part of the culture since the founding of the nation, with the frequency of their use varying from time to time. This reached a fever pitch immediately following the September 11 attacks, and while it has backed off since then, the sense of nationalism in America remains strong, perhaps the strongest of all nations in which the state does not directly force people into such observances. 
Score: 8/10, Trend: Steady Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights – Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, fascists are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of “need.” The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc. 
After 9/11, the Bush regime and their lapdogs in the right-wing media were largely successful in convincing people that torture and indefinite detention of those who were not convicted of crimes was justifiable for national security reasons. The Obama regime has taken some positive steps on these matters, but has murdered far more people with drone strikes than his predecessor. The left-wing media has largely given Obama a pass on this. At home, the War on Drugs has placed many innocent people into prison for decades. While the American people are becoming more opposed to such abuses of power, little real change has occurred. 
Score: 8/10, Trend: Slightly Up Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause – The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial, ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc. 
America has a dark history of this. Over the centuries, Native Americans, Blacks, Mexicans, Irish, Eastern Europeans, Germans, Jews, Japanese, communists, and Muslims have all been perceived as common threats or foes to be contained or eliminated. More than once, the state has been able to engage in wars due to yellow journalism or false flag operations successfully creating a new enemy du jour. With the War on Terrorism, the state has found its holy grail: a war which can be made indefinite against an omnipresent foe which it can never seem to vanquish, not that it would want to. 
Score: 10/10, Trend: Steady Supremacy of the Military – Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized. 
The United States has the largest military budget in the world, and spends more money on its military than the next seven nations combined. Despite a stagnant economy and decaying infrastructure, 20 percent of the federal budget is devoted to the military. This is equal to the combined budgets of Medicare and Medicaid, and is nearly as much as the budget for Social Security. To be critical of the military as an institution is considered to be nearly as bad as aiding the enemy by the lapdog media, as is criticizing the glamorization of soldiers and military service. Though a minority is becoming skeptical of this situation, no changes appear to be coming in the near future. 
Score: 10/10, Trend: Steady Rampant Sexism – The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Divorce, abortion and homosexuality are suppressed and the state is represented as the ultimate guardian of the family institution. 
The United States is one of the least sexist countries in the world. While the number of males in positions of political power outnumber females by about four to one, the United States ranks 94th out of 190 countries in this regard as of June 1, 2015. Over the last few decades, traditional gender roles have become less rigid. Divorce has become easier to obtain, with fault requirements being mostly removed as of 2015. Abortions were made legal nationwide in 1973, and same-sex marriage was made legal nationwide in 2015. A general hostility has developed toward government intervention into the family institution. 
Score: 3/10, Trend: Down Controlled Mass Media – Sometimes the media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in wartime, is very common. 
While the press in America is not directly controlled by the government, it is indirectly controlled. Government regulation and pro-state media personalities perpetuate a lapdog establishment that echoes government propaganda and eschews authentic investigative journalism. Those who would challenge this status quo by asking uncomfortable questions frequently find themselves victimized by slave-on-slave violence as the privileged establishment seeks to preserve its access to the halls of power and its usefulness in informing the public of government activities. Censorship is common with regard to certain words and topics which are not used or discussed on mainstream programming, especially during wartime, although this is mostly done without direct government involvement. Before and during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the establishment media consistently towed the government line and censored certain images, such as war deaths. As a result, alternative and independent media sources are growing in popularity and trust in the establishment media is at an all-time low, but they have yet to displace the establishment media. 
Score: 8/10, Trend: Slightly Down Obsession with National Security – Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses. 
At least since the First Red Scare following the Russian Revolution and continuing through World War II, the Cold War, and the War on Terrorism, the government has used fear of external enemies as a justification for its activities. National security is considered by many right-wing (and some left-wing) politicians to be the most important role of the state. Though many people believe this has gone too far in the wake of the Snowden leaks, little meaningful change has occurred. 
Score: 8/10, Trend: Steady Religion and Government are Intertwined – Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government’s policies or actions. 
There is a tradition of separation of church and state in America, but this is only true in the sense that there is no official state religion. Atheists, agnostics, and religious skeptics are few and far between in public office. Appeals to the tenets of Christianity, the most common religion in America, are frequently used by politicians to advance their agendas, even when those tenets are diametrically opposed to such agendas. Christian theories of just war play a significant role in American conservatism, and Christian ideas about helping the poor are used by American liberals to argue for government welfare programs. Religiosity among the American people is declining, but these conditions will likely remain stable for another generation or so. 
Score: 7/10, Trend: Down Corporate Power is Protected – The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite. 
Since soon after the Constitution was ratified, business interests have played a financial role in determining which candidates for office are successful in elections. With the Citizens United decision, this has become more open and somewhat more blatant. Of course, those who invest in political campaigns expect a return on that investment, and research shows that they get it in spades. A political aristocracy has been present throughout much of American history, with many candidates for office being related to prior office holders. The 2016 presidential election is shaping up to be more of the same. 
Score: 9/10, Trend: Up Labor Power is Suppressed – Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed. 
While labor unions have not been eliminated entirely in America, they have been declining in the private sector for quite some time. In 2014, only 6.6 percent of private sector workers were union members, the lowest level since 1932. However, government sector unions are much stronger, with 35.7 percent of government workers belonging to a union in 2014. While national syndicalism is a major part of fascist theory, it has only had minor influence in America in the form of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) labor union. 
Score: 6/10, Trend: Slightly Up Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts – Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts and letters is openly attacked. 
In America, the government is quite dependent on the intellectual classes to propagandize the people, and is therefore rather accommodating to them, to the point of creating a bubble in higher education that has benefited the intellectual classes at the expense of everyone else during the postwar period. That being said, it is becoming more common for professors and other academics to be attacked for their views. The rise in influence of social justice warriors is causing disdain for free expression to trend upward. 
Score: 4/10, Trend: Slightly Up Obsession with Crime and Punishment – Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forgo civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations. 
While many police accountability activists in America say that “badges don’t grant extra rights,” the fact is that in practice, they do. Police routinely engage in activities that would land an ordinary citizen in prison, and when they are investigated, it is either by an internal review process or a grand jury examination, each of which tend to be highly sympathetic to the police due to conflicts of interest. While there is no national police force with virtually unlimited power, the DEA, FBI, and Secret Service are quite powerful and are getting stronger. After 9/11, many people were willing to overlook police abuses, but this is changing. However, many efforts toward police accountability are being blunted by distractions, such as a focus on racism. 
Score: 8/10, Trend: Slightly Up Rampant Cronyism and Corruption – Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders. 
There is a revolving door in Washington, D.C. between being a member of Congress or federal employee and being a lobbyist for special interest groups. These special interest groups bribe politicians and regulators on behalf of wealthy business interests to write laws and regulations that favor their interests at the expense of competing businesses and individual citizens. Many of these laws and regulations work to shield business owners from civil and criminal liability. While it is uncommon for American rulers to steal national treasures, there is a tendency for the government to appropriate natural resources and sell access to them. This shows no signs of improving anytime soon. 
Score: 7/10, Trend: Up Fraudulent Elections – Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections. 
While there is no proof that American elections are a complete sham, there are clear cases of manipulation. While smear campaigns tend to be waged by each major political party against the other, assassination of opposition candidates is almost never seriously considered, let alone attempted. That being said, the two major parties have rigged election laws to keep third parties from having any reasonable chance of winning. Over the past few decades, gerrymandering of political district boundaries has been used to create districts which are either reliably Democratic or reliably Republican, with the result being that the fringe elements of each party are able to put people into office. The judiciary was arguably used to manipulate the 2000 presidential election, and courts usually act to control elections by siding against claims of unfairness by minor political parties. With the introduction of top-two primaries in recent years, third party and independent candidates are being excluded further. 
Score: 7/10, Trend: Slightly Up 
Overall, America gets a score of 103 out of 140, meaning that America is 73.6 percent of the way toward fascism and away from liberty. While the trends on the various characteristics of fascism are moving in different directions, the overall trend is slightly upward, meaning that the score could advance at a rate of one or two points per year. 
Now, wake up and examine which country is actually harming you and the rest of us. It’s time to put aside old grudges that date back to the Soviet days, in the same way you forgot the harm done to you in the past, by your now good neighbor, Germany.","A Measure of Fascism in America By wmw_admin on October 27, 2016 by Marcus Aurealeus, Facebook Note — OffGuardian.org Oct 27, 2016 
T he word “fascism” is generally used today as a pejorative to attack any idea that a speaker happens to dislike. But this word has a specific meaning and a specific historical context. It refers to an authoritarian, nationalistic system of government and social organization that is usually considered to be far right-wing. Historically, it was most popular in the 1930s, when the regimes of Hitler, Mussolini, and Franco were in their primes. Later examples include Indonesia under Suharto, Bolivia under Banzer, and Chile under Pinochet. In practice, fascism combines the ideas of collectivism, mercantilism, nationalism, (statist) syndicalism, and uniculturalism into a system where business leaders and political rulers work together to create public policies that benefit themselves at the expense of everyone else. 
To what extent is the United States of America in 2015 a fascist nation? In order to determine this, a means of measurement is needed. Lawrence Britt has studied fascist regimes and found that there are 14 characteristics which all of them have in common to some degree. Matthew Reece goes further and examines these characteristics and assigns each of them a value on a ten-point scale, with zero being completely absent and 10 being omnipresent. Let us also see how many are trending upward, trending downward, and holding steady. The final score on a 140-point scale will give a useful measure of the degree of fascism in America. Powerful and Continuing Nationalism – Fascists tend to make constant use of patriotic mottoes, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays. 
In America, patriotic mottoes, slogans, symbols, songs, and flags have been part of the culture since the founding of the nation, with the frequency of their use varying from time to time. This reached a fever pitch immediately following the September 11 attacks, and while it has backed off since then, the sense of nationalism in America remains strong, perhaps the strongest of all nations in which the state does not directly force people into such observances. 
Score: 8/10, Trend: Steady Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights – Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, fascists are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of “need.” The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc. 
After 9/11, the Bush regime and their lapdogs in the right-wing media were largely successful in convincing people that torture and indefinite detention of those who were not convicted of crimes was justifiable for national security reasons. The Obama regime has taken some positive steps on these matters, but has murdered far more people with drone strikes than his predecessor. The left-wing media has largely given Obama a pass on this. At home, the War on Drugs has placed many innocent people into prison for decades. While the American people are becoming more opposed to such abuses of power, little real change has occurred. 
Score: 8/10, Trend: Slightly Up Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause – The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial, ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc. 
America has a dark history of this. Over the centuries, Native Americans, Blacks, Mexicans, Irish, Eastern Europeans, Germans, Jews, Japanese, communists, and Muslims have all been perceived as common threats or foes to be contained or eliminated. More than once, the state has been able to engage in wars due to yellow journalism or false flag operations successfully creating a new enemy du jour. With the War on Terrorism, the state has found its holy grail: a war which can be made indefinite against an omnipresent foe which it can never seem to vanquish, not that it would want to. 
Score: 10/10, Trend: Steady Supremacy of the Military – Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized. 
The United States has the largest military budget in the world, and spends more money on its military than the next seven nations combined. Despite a stagnant economy and decaying infrastructure, 20 percent of the federal budget is devoted to the military. This is equal to the combined budgets of Medicare and Medicaid, and is nearly as much as the budget for Social Security. To be critical of the military as an institution is considered to be nearly as bad as aiding the enemy by the lapdog media, as is criticizing the glamorization of soldiers and military service. Though a minority is becoming skeptical of this situation, no changes appear to be coming in the near future.

10547,VIDEO: Watch Newt Gingrich UNLOAD on Megyn Kelly Over Trump,"Pinterest 
Newt Gingrich has accused Fox News’ Megyn Kelly of being “fascinated” by sex, and not caring at all about public policy in a shocking and startling interview. 
The former Speaker of the House said Kelly showed “bias” for mentioning the groping allegations against Donald Trump. 
Kelly responded by saying her fascination is not of “sex,” but of who was going to end up in the White House. Kelly has a history with Trump – getting into a shouting match with the Republican candidate over comments he made about women during a primary debate. 
What set Gingrich off was Kelly’s mention of the leaked “sex boasts” tapes, where Trump is heard to say he grabs women by the genitals. 
Gingrich attacked, saying the media was obsessed with spending time on the unsubstantiated allegations of sexual misconduct, which Trump has denied. “You are fascinated with sex and you don’t care about public policy,” he said. 
“I’m not fascinated by sex, but I’m fascinated about sexual predators,” Kelly said. 
The bias the media has against Trump – especially focusing on sex – is historic. 
“This is a scale of bias worthy of Pravda and Izvestia, ” Gingrich said.

3200,"Some GOP Donors Willing to Give to Many, Just Not Paul","Some of the biggest donors and fundraisers in the Republican Party, still uncertain who should get their support in 2016, are sprinkling their money around a presidential field that grows by the day.

The largesse born of their indecision has a notable exception: Rand Paul.

The Kentucky senator has aggressively tried to raise money around his effort to curtail the surveillance powers of the National Security Agency, emailing supporters and posting messages on social media imploring people to ""celebrate this victory"" with their cash.

In doing so, he's exacerbated the perception among some of the GOP's most generous donors that his positions on foreign policy make him an unacceptable choice for the White House. This is especially so to those who consider an aggressive posture abroad and support for Israel paramount.

""I do not know of a single person in Mitt Romney's donor network who will be with Rand Paul,"" said Phil Rosen, a Manhattan attorney and top fundraiser for the 2012 Republican nominee. Rosen said he met with Paul and politely told him he wouldn't be supporting him ""because of his isolationist and libertarian policies.""

Rosen hasn't settled on his choice in next year's primary contest but expects to decide soon from a short list. Other prominent donors are doing the same, with some willing to give money to multiple candidates in the early stages of the campaign, but not to Paul.

Among them: Las Vegas casino owner Sheldon Adelson, New York hedge fund pioneer Michael Steinhardt and Ken Abramowitz, founder of a venture capital firm in New York. All three have given money to South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who announced his presidential campaign on Monday by saying he wants ""to be president to defeat the enemies trying to kill us.""

Those donors, like many of the Republican Party's biggest spenders, are looking for the strongest candidate on foreign policy, especially on the protection of Israel. That's become the centerpiece of not only Graham's campaign, but also is a featured aspect of the bids of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.

""Graham in particular has a terrific record in Congress and is experienced and articulate,"" said Steinhardt, who is also giving to former New York Gov. George Pataki and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee.

The weight of donor opposition to Paul hit his campaign soon after he launched it in April, when a politically active nonprofit, the Foundation for a Secure and Prosperous America, began a $1 million television advertising campaign against him in the four early primary states. The nonprofit can raise unlimited money and is not legally required to disclose its donors.

Several other groups are prepared to pounce on Paul if they sense he is gaining traction in the race. Among them is a group led by John Bolton, a former ambassador to the United Nations who recently decided against running himself, but plans to push for strong national security policies from the sidelines.

""I've spoken to well over 1,000 major Republican donors and can remember only one who agreed with Rand Paul on foreign policy,"" Bolton said. ""The views he represents are a tiny, tiny minority within the Republican Party.""

Unlike several of the other Republican candidates for president, Paul doesn't have an obvious billionaire — or group of billionaires — backing his campaign, as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie does with Home Depot founder Ken Langone and Rubio does in car dealer Norman Braman.

Campaigning in South Carolina last week, when he spoke about his fight against renewing the NSA's authority to collect Americans' phone records in bulk, Paul said he isn't concerned about the big donors lining up against him. But he said he wouldn't turn down their money.

""If you know some billionaires, and you want to send them our way, we're happy to talk to them,"" Paul said. ""It's more about votes than it is about dollars, and I think we're going to have plenty of money to compete.""

Paul said he's counting on small-dollar donations raised primarily online, the kind he's tried to drum up during the debate that has resulted in at least the temporary suspension of the NSA's authority to collect Americans' calling records.

He's attracted enthusiasm outside the usual Republican circles, particularly from college-aged voters with a distaste for military engagement and others who put civil liberties at the forefront of their concerns.

Republican pollster Frank Luntz, who isn't aligned with any 2016 candidate, said what Paul lacks in traditional deep-pocketed donor enthusiasm, he could make up for in smaller contributors.

""He's not going to have a traditional campaign because he's not going to be a traditional candidate,"" Luntz said. ""That comes with advantages and disadvantages.""

Paul's campaign said it raised more than $1 million online in his first 24 hours as a candidate, but wouldn't say how much it has raised around the NSA issue. It will report on its finances next month.","Some GOP Donors Willing to Give to Many, Just Not Paul Some of the biggest donors and fundraisers in the Republican Party, still uncertain who should get their support in 2016, are sprinkling their money around a presidential field that grows by the day.

5221,Fact-checking the vice-presidential debate between Kaine and Pence,"The Democratic vice-presidential nominee, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, and the Republican nominee, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, debated Oct. 4 at Longwood University in Farmville, Va. Here is a roundup of 25 suspicious or interesting claims that were made. As is our practice, we do not award Pinocchios when we do a roundup of facts in debates.

Kaine surely meant to say nuclear weapons but it came out as chemical weapons. (Later in the debate, he said “[Clinton] went toe-to-toe with Russia as secretary of state to do the New START Agreement to reduce Russia’s nuclear stockpile.”)

Even so, Kaine overstates the impact of the 2011 New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty agreement, which Clinton helped negotiate as secretary of state.

New START placed tighter limits on deployed strategic weapons but Russia was actually already meeting the treaty’s limits, for the most part, when the treaty’s implementation began. Indeed, Russia has increased deployed nuclear weapons from 1,537 in February 2011 to 1,796 in September of this year. Also, the treaty does not restrict either country from stockpiling weapons, nor does it require them to destroy any existing weapons.

Russia’s total nuclear warhead arsenal has been on a steady decline from 40,000 since 1986. The total has hovered around 4,500 since 2012, during Obama’s presidency.

Kaine leans way over on his skis here. The Iranian nuclear agreement was actually negotiated by Clinton’s successor, John Kerry, though Clinton helped tee up the negotiations by increasing sanctions on the Islamic Republic. The deal, which has been sharply criticized by Republicans, did increase the amount of time that Iran would need to build a nuclear weapon by reducing its centrifuges for uranium enrichment and its stockpile of enriched uranium; international monitoring of Iran’s nuclear facilities was also implemented. But key elements of the deal expire in 15 years (some go longer) and Iran’s nuclear infrastructure remains in place.

While Iran has insisted it has no interest in building nuclear weapons, the deal does not eliminate the risk that it will obtain nuclear bombs. The agreement limits Iran’s civilian nuclear program and it is also contains an indefinite prohibition on activities related to a weapons program, defined in Annex 1, Section T. Whether those elements eliminates the nuclear weapons program is a matter of opinion.

Indeed, Clinton’s economic plan would raise an estimated $1.46 trillion in tax revenues over the next decade, according to an analysis by economist Mark Zandi. But the tax hike “falls almost exclusively on the most highly paid,” the analysis says.

This figure does not take into account the impact of her other proposals on the economy. For example, his report also said that if Clinton were able to fully implement her economic plans, the economy would add an additional 3.2 million jobs during the first four years of her presidency. Combined with anticipated job creation under current law, that adds up to 10.4 million jobs. But the report also said that Clinton would face significant roadblocks to getting her economic plan through Congress, resulting in far fewer job gains.

Trump has, indeed, said all of those things.

During his campaign announcement, Trump said: “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.“ We awarded Trump’s claim connecting illegal immigrants from Mexico and crime Four Pinocchios.

In 2007, Trump called Rosie O’Donnell “a slob,” “a pig” and a “degenerate” in a single speech. He has called Arianna Huffington “a dog” and said New York Times columnist Gail Collins had “the face of a dog.”

Trump did say that the Indiana-born U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel had an “inherent conflict of interest” because of his Mexican heritage and Trump’s plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump has said McCain was “not a war hero,” and that McCain is “a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren’t captured.” Trump has, indeed, said: “We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African Americans, Hispanics, are living in hell, because it’s so dangerous.” And Trump was one of the most high-profile “birthers” who questioned whether Obama was a U.S. citizen.

Earlier in the campaign, Trump said women who receive illegal abortions should be subject to “some sort of punishment.” But he reversed that statement several hours later, after widespread criticism from those on both sides of the abortion rights issue. He amended his statement to say that the doctors, not women, should be punished.

This is correct. A key difference here is that Nixon did not release his taxes while he was a presidential candidate; he did so in 1973, a year after he was reelected.

Presidential candidates have no legal obligation to release their returns, but there has long been a tradition to do so for the sake of transparency. Trump has cited a pending Internal Revenue Service audit, even though the first president to release his taxes, Nixon, did so in the middle of an audit. Moreover, Trump has not released his tax returns from before 2009, which are no longer under audit, according to his attorney.

Pence is correct on raw numbers regarding education spending, but is incorrect when the figures are adjusted for inflation.

In fiscal year 2017, state spending on higher education and K-12 education is the largest in Indiana’s history. But adjusted for inflation, the 2017 appropriations are not quite as high as they were in 2010 and 2011, said Lawrence DeBoer, Purdue University economist and an expert on Indiana’s state budget. By 2017, Indiana state spending on education will be almost back to 2011 levels, DeBoer said.

On infrastructure, Pence began improving the state’s roads only after an emergency repair of the Interstate 65 bridge led to a month-long traffic problem and caused a political liability, the Associated Press reported. Political ads attacked Pence for saving money in the state’s reserves at the expense of underfunding the state’s infrastructure.

Pence then proposed a plan to improve roads “that relied on borrowing, drawing down state reserves and accounting gimmicks to reach an advertised $1 billion sticker price,” the AP reported. “In the end, he got just a fraction of that after Indiana’s Republican-controlled Legislature balked. And much of the money set aside for local governments came from local taxes held in state reserves that were already supposed to be returned.”

Clinton has said she would expand Obama’s executive actions on immigration and has advocated for comprehensive immigration reform, including a pathway to citizenship. But she also has supported enhanced border security. And her immigration proposal includes “humane, targeted and effective” enforcement and focusing immigration resources on detaining and deporting those “who pose a threat to public safety.”

[Update: Hacked emails released on Oct. 7 showed Clinton apparently said in a paid closed-door speech to a Brazilian bank: “My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders,” through green energy.

The Clinton campaign has refused to authenticate the hacked emails, but campaign manager Robby Mook said in an Oct. 9 CBS “Face the Nation” interview that Clinton was “talking about integrating green energy between North and South America. … If the question is, ‘Does Hillary Clinton support throwing open our borders?’ Absolutely not. And she is going to do everything she can to fight to protect the interests of workers in this country.”]

This is correct. Clinton has said she supports President Obama’s decision to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees in fiscal year 2016 — and that she would support an increase up to 65,000. That is a 550 percent increase from 10,000. But Clinton has not yet disclosed her plan for the new fiscal year or beyond.

This map below shows where Syrian refugees have ended up in the United States.

Maybe the GOP ticket did not precisely use the word “great” or “better,” but Kaine pretty much hits the target here.

Pence told CNN just a few weeks ago: “I think it’s inarguable that Vladimir Putin has been a stronger leader in his country than Barack Obama has been.” Pence made these remarks just after Trump asserted that Putin has “been a leader far more than our president has been a leader.”

Kaine repeats a line that recently earned Hillary Clinton Three Pinocchios. But no credible analyst would cite the Bush tax cuts as playing a key role in spurring the economic crash.

Kaine puts it even more starkly than Clinton. The Clinton campaign tried to suggest income inequality, exacerbated by tax cuts, led to the stagnation of the middle class and spurred excess borrowing and leverage — key components of the crash along with lax regulation. But that’s a real stretch, given that a housing bubble was the key trigger. The causes of the Great Recession are complex and debatable, but there’s no debate that it is wrong to put the Bush tax cuts at the top of the list.

This isn’t a direct quote about deporting all undocumented immigrants, but Trump did say that all “criminal illegal immigrants” (likely referring to undocumented immigrants convicted of a crime) “are going to be gone. It will be over.”

Among other claims Trump made at the Aug. 31 Phoenix rally about removing those here illegally:

But Trump also laid out his deportation priorities during the speech. Among them: Targeting at least 5 million and as many as 6.5 million undocumented immigrants who would be subject to swift removal. That is about half of the 11 million undocumented people estimated to be living in the United States.

Pence misconstrued an Associated Press report here, similar to the way Donald Trump did earlier in the campaign.

The AP analyzed State Department records and looked specifically at Clinton’s meetings on the phone or in person with 154 people who were not federal employees or foreign government representatives. This narrowed down the denominator to a small subcategory of people Clinton met with as secretary of state, since the majority of her diplomatic work would involve representatives of foreign governments. In addition, the AP report is based on partial records released by the State Department so far and does not reflect the full scope of people with whom Clinton met as secretary of state.

The AP found that 85 of those 154 people, or “more than half,” had donated to the Clinton Foundation or “pledged commitments to its international programs.” The 85 donors collectively contributed as much as $156 million, the AP reported. There were representatives from at least 16 foreign governments, who donated as much as $170 million to the charity, but those representatives were not included in the 154 number, the AP reported.

This is wrong. Counting from January 2009, nearly 11 million private-sector jobs have been created in the United States, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. If you count all jobs, including government jobs, the figure is 10.5 million.

So how does Kaine come up with 15 million? He’s counting from the low point for jobs in Obama’s presidency, February 2010. When you start the clock from then, the tally is 15 million private-sector jobs and 14.8 million overall jobs.

The last time we checked, February 2010 was 6 1/2 years ago. So with this claim, Kaine is trying to wipe off a year of Obama’s presidency.

Moreover, as a general matter, regular readers know that we tend to discount job-creation records by a president, as so much of the record is due to economic forces beyond a president’s control.

Mark Zandi, a respected economist at Moody’s Analytics, did issue a report saying that if Trump’s economic plans were fully implemented, 3.5 million jobs would disappear, incomes would stagnate, debt would explode, and stock prices would plummet. (This compares to an anticipated increase of 6 million jobs under current Obama administration policies.) In another report, Zandi also said that if Clinton were able to fully implement her economic plans, the economy would create an additional 3.2 million jobs during the first four years of her presidency. Combined with anticipated job creation under current law, that adds up to 10.4 million jobs.

But both reports were highly skeptical that either candidate would be able to get their plans through Congress — even a Republican-controlled one during a Trump presidency — because so many of Trump’s positions are such a departure from GOP principles. Even so, the report said the U.S. economy would likely suffer under a Trump presidency. (The report was issued in June, and Moody’s has not issued an updated report that would reflect additional policies announced by Trump, including a revised tax plan. But the report said Trump’s trade policies would be especially damaging.)

Pence makes it sound like this is U.S. taxpayer money — and he uses a too-high estimate. Because of international sanctions over its nuclear program, Iran had billions of dollars in assets that were frozen in foreign banks around the globe. With sanctions lifted, in theory, those funds would be unlocked.

But the Treasury Department has estimated that once Iran fulfills other obligations, it would have about $55 billion left. (Much of the other money was obligated to illiquid projects in China.) For its part, the Central Bank of Iran said the number was actually $32 billion, not $55 billion.

Trump has called the North Atlantic Treaty Organization obsolete, but he has not said he wants to get rid of it. Asked specifically by The Washington Post in March if he wanted to pull out of NATO, he said, “I don’t want to pull it out. NATO was set up at a different time. NATO was set up when we were a richer country. We’re not a rich country anymore. … I think NATO as a concept is good, but it is not as good as it was when it first evolved.” Trump has argued that “distribution of costs” has to be changed but, as we have noted, Trump frequently overstates the burden on the United States.

Kaine is referring to Trump’s 2000 book, “The America We Deserve,” where he made such a comparison about Social Security and said he wanted to privatize the program: “The workers of America have been forced to invest a sixth of our wages into a huge Ponzi scheme. The pyramids are made of paper-mache.”

Trump added in the book: “Privatization would be good for all of us. As it stands today, 13.6 percent of women on Social Security live in poverty.”

But that book was published 16 years ago. On the campaign trail, Trump has said he wants to “keep Social Security intact.… I’m not going to cut it.” His specific plans for the program, however, are vague. His campaign has said “the key to preserving Social Security and other programs that benefit AARP members is to have an economy that is robust and growing.”

For more on Social Security and allegations it is a Ponzi scheme, see The Fact Checker’s guide to critical questions about the program.

This is a zombie claim that just won’t go away. We have awarded it Three Pinocchios, and fact checkers repeatedly debunked this during the 2012 presidential election.

Indeed, the number of ships (272) as of Oct. 4 is the lowest count since 1916 (245 ships). But a lot has changed in 100 years, including the need and capacity of ships. After all, it’s now a matter of modern nuclear-powered fleet carriers versus the gunboats and small warships of 100 years ago. The push for ships under the Reagan era (to build the Navy up to 600-ship levels) no longer exists, and ships from that era are now retiring.

This talking point is a poor way to depict the country’s naval fleet needs. Gunboats of 1915 and aircraft carriers of 2015 are not the same. And military budgets, fleet needs and historical circumstances are much different in 2015 than they were in 1916.

Pence reprises a GOP talking point from the 2012 campaign, but it’s not correct. Obama substituted a different system, but it was on the recommendation of then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates, a Republican. Gates, in fact, had recommended the original plan to President George W. Bush and then decided the new system implemented by Obama was more effective, less costly and timelier than the Bush plan.

Gates, in his 2013 memoir, noted that while the Obama administration had stumbled in failing to lay the diplomatic groundwork for the shift, looking “like a bunch of bumbling fools,” the Bush plan was already running into trouble in both Prague and Warsaw and likely would have been rejected by parliaments in both countries. “The Polish and Czech governments were relieved,” he wrote.

“I sincerely believed the new program was better — more in accord with the political realities in Europe and more effective against the emerging Iranian threat,” Gates added. “While there certainly were some in the State Department and the White House who believed the third site in Europe was incompatible with the Russian ‘reset,’ we in Defense did not. Making the Russians happy wasn’t exactly on my to-do list.”

In fact, Gates says, the Russians quickly concluded that the Obama plan was even worse from their perspective, as it eventually might have capabilities that could be used against Russian intercontinental missiles.

“How ironic that U.S. critics of the new approach had portrayed it as a big concession to the Russians,” Gates added sardonically. “It would have been nice to hear a critic in Washington — just once in my career — say, Well I got that wrong.”

Trump has walked back the particular claim that Kaine cites, that “wages are too high.” Of course, Trump has flip-flopped on the minimum wage at least five times since August 2015 and has consistently contradicted his own statements, making it hard to track exactly where he stands on the issue at a given time. Trump’s stance on this matter, as of August 2016, was that he supports “raising it to $10 at the federal level, but believes states should set the minimum wage as appropriate for their state.”

During a November 2015 Republican primary debate, Trump was asked whether he was “sympathetic to the protesters’ cause since a $15 wage works out to about $31,000 a year.” His full answer, with the part Kaine is quoting in bold:

Days later, Trump clarified he was referring to whether he would increase the minimum wage. He would not raise it, because then it would be “too high,” he said.

Kaine correctly notes that Pence, as a congressman, voted in 2007 against raising the minimum wage above $5.15.

Pence made this claim in the context of abortion and choosing whether to be for or against abortion rights. But polling does not support this. In fact, it shows young adults’ views on abortion rights are about the same as their elders — unlike issues like marijuana and gay marriage, where young people are more liberal.

Among adults aged 18 to 29, 58 percent said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, and 39 percent said it should be illegal in all or most cases, according to a 2014 Pew Research Center poll. That was similar to those aged 30 to 49 (59 percent supported abortion, 38 percent opposed) and those aged 50 to 64 (56 percent supported, 37 percent opposed).

“Partial-birth abortion” is usually used to refer to later-term abortions using a specific fetus-extraction method.

Clinton has said she supports a ban on late-term abortions, including partial-birth abortions, as long as the health and the life of the mother are protected. As senator, Clinton opposed the Partial-Birth Abortion Act of 2003, which did not include a health exception.

Earlier this year, Clinton again said she is “on record in favor of a late pregnancy regulation that would have exceptions for the life and health of the mother.”

Trump has, indeed, said that countries such as South Korea, Japan and Saudi Arabia should have nuclear weapons because nuclear proliferation is inevitable. Trump has said that countries like Japan and South Korea would be “better off” if they were armed with nuclear weapons, in order to defend themselves from North Korea. And Trumps said he considers nuclear weapons a last resort, though he would not “rule anything out” regarding their use.

For example, during a CNN town hall in March, Trump was asked: “So if you said, Japan, yes, it’s fine, you get nuclear weapons, South Korea, you as well, and Saudi Arabia says we want them, too?”

Trump answered: “Can I be honest with you? It’s going to happen, anyway. It’s going to happen anyway. It’s only a question of time. They’re going to start having them or we have to get rid of them entirely. But you have so many countries already, China, Pakistan, you have so many countries, Russia, you have so many countries right now that have them.”

This is an odd, inaccurate comment. The Russia-Georgia war took place in 2008, when Clinton was still a U.S. senator. Bush’s secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, lodged the protests. Whatever diplomatic pressure the Bush team had put on Russia over Georgia was abandoned when President Obama was elected and the administration decided to pursue the ill-fated “reset.”

Kaine gets this right, as Pence repeated a false claim that is popular on the right. The Clinton Foundation does not dole out grants, like a typical foundation, but instead directs the donations it raises directly for specified charitable activities. So simply only looking at the grants does not tell the whole story about the foundation’s activities.

The American Institute of Philanthropy’s “Charity Watch” gives the Clinton Foundation an “A” rating for its efficiency (the top rating is A+). It says the foundation spends 88 percent of its expenses on programs and 12 percent on overhead. It also says the Clinton Foundation spends just $2 to raise $100.

Sign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter","Fact-checking the vice-presidential debate between Kaine and Pence The Democratic vice-presidential nominee, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, and the Republican nominee, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, debated Oct. 4 at Longwood University in Farmville, Va. Here is a roundup of 25 suspicious or interesting claims that were made. As is our practice, we do not award Pinocchios when we do a roundup of facts in debates.

Kaine surely meant to say nuclear weapons but it came out as chemical weapons. (Later in the debate, he said “[Clinton] went toe-to-toe with Russia as secretary of state to do the New START Agreement to reduce Russia’s nuclear stockpile.”)

Even so, Kaine overstates the impact of the 2011 New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty agreement, which Clinton helped negotiate as secretary of state.

New START placed tighter limits on deployed strategic weapons but Russia was actually already meeting the treaty’s limits, for the most part, when the treaty’s implementation began. Indeed, Russia has increased deployed nuclear weapons from 1,537 in February 2011 to 1,796 in September of this year. Also, the treaty does not restrict either country from stockpiling weapons, nor does it require them to destroy any existing weapons.

Russia’s total nuclear warhead arsenal has been on a steady decline from 40,000 since 1986. The total has hovered around 4,500 since 2012, during Obama’s presidency.

Kaine leans way over on his skis here. The Iranian nuclear agreement was actually negotiated by Clinton’s successor, John Kerry, though Clinton helped tee up the negotiations by increasing sanctions on the Islamic Republic. The deal, which has been sharply criticized by Republicans, did increase the amount of time that Iran would need to build a nuclear weapon by reducing its centrifuges for uranium enrichment and its stockpile of enriched uranium; international monitoring of Iran’s nuclear facilities was also implemented. But key elements of the deal expire in 15 years (some go longer) and Iran’s nuclear infrastructure remains in place.

While Iran has insisted it has no interest in building nuclear weapons, the deal does not eliminate the risk that it will obtain nuclear bombs. The agreement limits Iran’s civilian nuclear program and it is also contains an indefinite prohibition on activities related to a weapons program, defined in Annex 1, Section T. Whether those elements eliminates the nuclear weapons program is a matter of opinion.

Indeed, Clinton’s economic plan would raise an estimated $1.46 trillion in tax revenues over the next decade, according to an analysis by economist Mark Zandi. But the tax hike “falls almost exclusively on the most highly paid,” the analysis says.

This figure does not take into account the impact of her other proposals on the economy. For example, his report also said that if Clinton were able to fully implement her economic plans, the economy would add an additional 3.2 million jobs during the first four years of her presidency. Combined with anticipated job creation under current law, that adds up to 10.4 million jobs. But the report also said that Clinton would face significant roadblocks to getting her economic plan through Congress, resulting in far fewer job gains.

Trump has, indeed, said all of those things.

During his campaign announcement, Trump said: “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.“ We awarded Trump’s claim connecting illegal immigrants from Mexico and crime Four Pinocchios.

In 2007, Trump called Rosie O’Donnell “a slob,” “a pig” and a “degenerate” in a single speech. He has called Arianna Huffington “a dog” and said New York Times columnist Gail Collins had “the face of a dog.”

Trump did say that the Indiana-born U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel had an “inherent conflict of interest” because of his Mexican heritage and Trump’s plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump has said McCain was “not a war hero,” and that McCain is “a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren’t captured.” Trump has, indeed, said: “We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African Americans, Hispanics, are living in hell, because it’s so dangerous.” And Trump was one of the most high-profile “birthers” who questioned whether Obama was a U.S. citizen.

Earlier in the campaign, Trump said women who receive illegal abortions should be subject to “some sort of punishment.” But he reversed that statement several hours later, after widespread criticism from those on both sides of the abortion rights issue. He amended his statement to say that the doctors, not women, should be punished.

This is correct. A key difference here is that Nixon did not release his taxes while he was a presidential candidate; he did so in 1973, a year after he was reelected.

Presidential candidates have no legal obligation to release their returns, but there has long been a tradition to do so for the sake of transparency. Trump has cited a pending Internal Revenue Service audit, even though the first president to release his taxes, Nixon, did so in the middle of an audit. Moreover, Trump has not released his tax returns from before 2009, which are no longer under audit, according to his attorney.

Pence is correct on raw numbers regarding education spending, but is incorrect when the figures are adjusted for inflation.

In fiscal year 2017, state spending on higher education and K-12 education is the largest in Indiana’s history. But adjusted for inflation, the 2017 appropriations are not quite as high as they were in 2010 and 2011, said Lawrence DeBoer, Purdue University economist and an expert on Indiana’s state budget. By 2017, Indiana state spending on education will be almost back to 2011 levels, DeBoer said.

On infrastructure, Pence began improving the state’s roads only after an emergency repair of the Interstate 65 bridge led to a month-long traffic problem and caused a political liability, the Associated Press reported. Political ads attacked Pence for saving money in the state’s reserves at the expense of underfunding the state’s infrastructure.

Pence then proposed a plan to improve roads “that relied on borrowing, drawing down state reserves and accounting gimmicks to reach an advertised $1 billion sticker price,” the AP reported. “In the end, he got just a fraction of that after Indiana’s Republican-controlled Legislature balked. And much of the money set aside for local governments came from local taxes held in state reserves that were already supposed to be returned.”

Clinton has said she would expand Obama’s executive actions on immigration and has advocated for comprehensive immigration reform, including a pathway to citizenship. But she also has supported enhanced border security. And her immigration proposal includes “humane, targeted and effective” enforcement and focusing immigration resources on detaining and deporting those “who pose a threat to public safety.”

[Update: Hacked emails released on Oct. 7 showed Clinton apparently said in a paid closed-door speech to a Brazilian bank: “My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders,” through green energy.

The Clinton campaign has refused to authenticate the hacked emails, but campaign manager Robby Mook said in an Oct. 9 CBS “Face the Nation” interview that Clinton was “talking about integrating green energy between North and South America. … If the question is, ‘Does Hillary Clinton support throwing open our borders?’ Absolutely not. And she is going to do everything she can to fight to protect the interests of workers in this country.”]

This is correct. Clinton has said she supports President Obama’s decision to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees in fiscal year 2016 — and that she would support an increase up to 65,000. That is a 550 percent increase from 10,000. But Clinton has not yet disclosed her plan for the new fiscal year or beyond.

This map below shows where Syrian refugees have ended up in the United States.

Maybe the GOP ticket did not precisely use the word “great” or “better,” but Kaine pretty much hits the target here.

Pence told CNN just a few weeks ago: “I think it’s inarguable that Vladimir Putin has been a stronger leader in his country than Barack Obama has been.” Pence made these remarks just after Trump asserted that Putin has “been a leader far more than our president has been a leader.”

Kaine repeats a line that recently earned Hillary Clinton Three Pinocchios. But no credible analyst would cite the Bush tax cuts as playing a key role in spurring the economic crash.

Kaine puts it even more starkly than Clinton. The Clinton campaign tried to suggest income inequality, exacerbated by tax cuts, led to the stagnation of the middle class and spurred excess borrowing and leverage — key components of the crash along with lax regulation. But that’s a real stretch, given that a housing bubble was the key trigger. The causes of the Great Recession are complex and debatable, but there’s no debate that it is wrong to put the Bush tax cuts at the top of the list.

This isn’t a direct quote about deporting all undocumented immigrants, but Trump did say that all “criminal illegal immigrants” (likely referring to undocumented immigrants convicted of a crime) “are going to be gone. It will be over.”

Among other claims Trump made at the Aug. 31 Phoenix rally about removing those here illegally:

But Trump also laid out his deportation priorities during the speech. Among them: Targeting at least 5 million and as many as 6.5 million undocumented immigrants who would be subject to swift removal. That is about half of the 11 million undocumented people estimated to be living in the United States.

Pence misconstrued an Associated Press report here, similar to the way Donald Trump did earlier in the campaign.

The AP analyzed State Department records and looked specifically at Clinton’s meetings on the phone or in person with 154 people who were not federal employees or foreign government representatives. This narrowed down the denominator to a small subcategory of people Clinton met with as secretary of state, since the majority of her diplomatic work would involve representatives of foreign governments. In addition, the AP report is based on partial records released by the State Department so far and does not reflect the full scope of people with whom Clinton met as secretary of state.

The AP found that 85 of those 154 people, or “more than half,” had donated to the Clinton Foundation or “pledged commitments to its international programs.” The 85 donors collectively contributed as much as $156 million, the AP reported. There were representatives from at least 16 foreign governments, who donated as much as $170 million to the charity, but those representatives were not included in the 154 number, the AP reported.

This is wrong. Counting from January 2009, nearly 11 million private-sector jobs have been created in the United States, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. If you count all jobs, including government jobs, the figure is 10.5 million.

So how does Kaine come up with 15 million? He’s counting from the low point for jobs in Obama’s presidency, February 2010. When you start the clock from then, the tally is 15 million private-sector jobs and 14.8 million overall jobs.

The last time we checked, February 2010 was 6 1/2 years ago. So with this claim, Kaine is trying to wipe off a year of Obama’s presidency.

Moreover, as a general matter, regular readers know that we tend to discount job-creation records by a president, as so much of the record is due to economic forces beyond a president’s control.

Mark Zandi, a respected economist at Moody’s Analytics, did issue a report saying that if Trump’s economic plans were fully implemented, 3.5 million jobs would disappear, incomes would stagnate, debt would explode, and stock prices would plummet. (This compares to an anticipated increase of 6 million jobs under current Obama administration policies.) In another report, Zandi also said that if Clinton were able to fully implement her economic plans, the economy would create an additional 3.2 million jobs during the first four years of her presidency. Combined with anticipated job creation under current law, that adds up to 10.4 million jobs.

But both reports were highly skeptical that either candidate would be able to get their plans through Congress — even a Republican-controlled one during a Trump presidency — because so many of Trump’s positions are such a departure from GOP principles. Even so, the report said the U.S. economy would likely suffer under a Trump presidency. (The report was issued in June, and Moody’s has not issued an updated report that would reflect additional policies announced by Trump, including a revised tax plan. But the report said Trump’s trade policies would be especially damaging.)

Pence makes it sound like this is U.S. taxpayer money — and he uses a too-high estimate. Because of international sanctions over its nuclear program, Iran had billions of dollars in assets that were frozen in foreign banks around the globe. With sanctions lifted, in theory, those funds would be unlocked.

But the Treasury Department has estimated that once Iran fulfills other obligations, it would have about $55 billion left. (Much of the other money was obligated to illiquid projects in China.) For its part, the Central Bank of Iran said the number was actually $32 billion, not $55 billion.

Trump has called the North Atlantic Treaty Organization obsolete, but he has not said he wants to get rid of it. Asked specifically by The Washington Post in March if he wanted to pull out of NATO, he said, “I don’t want to pull it out. NATO was set up at a different time. NATO was set up when we were a richer country. We’re not a rich country anymore. … I think NATO as a concept is good, but it is not as good as it was when it first evolved.” Trump has argued that “distribution of costs” has to be changed but, as we have noted, Trump frequently overstates the burden on the United States.

Kaine is referring to Trump’s 2000 book, “The America We Deserve,” where he made such a comparison about Social Security and said he wanted to privatize the program: “The workers of America have been forced to invest a sixth of our wages into a huge Ponzi scheme. The pyramids are made of paper-mache.”

Trump added in the book: “Privatization would be good for all of us. As it stands today, 13.6 percent of women on Social Security live in poverty.”

But that book was published 16 years ago. On the campaign trail, Trump has said he wants to “keep Social Security intact.… I’m not going to cut it.” His specific plans for the program, however, are vague. His campaign has said “the key to preserving Social Security and other programs that benefit AARP members is to have an economy that is robust and growing.”

For more on Social Security and allegations it is a Ponzi scheme, see The Fact Checker’s guide to critical questions about the program.

This is a zombie claim that just won’t go away. We have awarded it Three Pinocchios, and fact checkers repeatedly debunked this during the 2012 presidential election.

Indeed, the number of ships (272) as of Oct. 4 is the lowest count since 1916 (245 ships). But a lot has changed in 100 years, including the need and capacity of ships. After all, it’s now a matter of modern nuclear-powered fleet carriers versus the gunboats and small warships of 100 years ago. The push for ships under the Reagan era (to build the Navy up to 600-ship levels) no longer exists, and ships from that era are now retiring.

This talking point is a poor way to depict the country’s naval fleet needs. Gunboats of 1915 and aircraft carriers of 2015 are not the same. And military budgets, fleet needs and historical circumstances are much different in 2015 than they were in 1916.

Pence reprises a GOP talking point from the 2012 campaign, but it’s not correct. Obama substituted a different system, but it was on the recommendation of then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates, a Republican. Gates, in fact, had recommended the original plan to President George W. Bush and then decided the new system implemented by Obama was more effective, less costly and timelier than the Bush plan.

Gates, in his 2013 memoir, noted that while the Obama administration had stumbled in failing to lay the diplomatic groundwork for the shift, looking “like a bunch of bumbling fools,” the Bush plan was already running into trouble in both Prague and Warsaw and likely would have been rejected by parliaments in both countries. “The Polish and Czech governments were relieved,” he wrote.

“I sincerely believed the new program was better — more in accord with the political realities in Europe and more effective against the emerging Iranian threat,” Gates added. “While there certainly were some in the State Department and the White House who believed the third site in Europe was incompatible with the Russian ‘reset,’ we in Defense did not. Making the Russians happy wasn’t exactly on my to-do list.”

In fact, Gates says, the Russians quickly concluded that the Obama plan was even worse from their perspective, as it eventually might have capabilities that could be used against Russian intercontinental missiles.

“How ironic that U.S. critics of the new approach had portrayed it as a big concession to the Russians,” Gates added sardonically. “It would have been nice to hear a critic in Washington — just once in my career — say, Well I got that wrong.”

earlier year clinton say “on record favor late pregnancy regulation would exceptions life health mother.”

trump indeed say country south korea japan saudi arabia nuclear weapon nuclear proliferation inevitable trump say country like japan south korea would “better off” arm nuclear weapon order defend north korea trump say considers nuclear weapon last resort though would “rule anything out” regard use.

for example cnn town hall march trump ask “so say japan yes it’s fine get nuclear weapon south korea well saudi arabia say want too?”

trump answer “can honest it’s go happen anyway it’s go happen anyway it’s question time they’re go start get rid entirely many country already china pakistan many country russia many country right them.”

this odd inaccurate comment russia-georgia war take place clinton still u.s senator bush’s secretary state condoleezza rice lodge protest whatever diplomatic pressure bush team put russia georgia abandon president obama elect administration decide pursue ill-fated “reset.”

kaine surely mean say nuclear weapon come chemical weapon later debate say “[clinton go toe-to-toe russia secretary state new start agreement reduce russia’s nuclear stockpile.”)

even kaine overstates impact new start strategic arm reduction treaty agreement clinton help negotiate secretary state.

new start place tight limit deploy strategic weapon russia actually already meet treaty’s limit part treaty’s implementation begin indeed russia increase deployed nuclear weapons from february september year also treaty restrict either country stockpile weapon require destroy exist weapons.

russia’s total nuclear warhead arsenal steady decline since total has hover around since obama’s presidency.

this figure take account impact proposal economy example report also say clinton able fully implement economic plan economy would add additional million job first four year presidency combine anticipated job creation current law add million job report also say clinton would face significant roadblock get economic plan congress result far few job gains.

trump indeed say things.

during campaign announcement trump say “when mexico send people they’re send best they’re send they’re send they’re send people lot problem they’re bring problem u they’re bring drug they’re bring crime they’re rapist assume good people.“ award trump’s claim connect illegal immigrant mexico crime four pinocchios.

in trump call rosie o’donnell “a slob,” “a pig” “degenerate” single speech call arianna huffington “a dog” say new york time columnist gail collins “the face dog.”

trump say indiana-born u.s district court judge gonzalo curiel “inherent conflict interest” mexican heritage trump’s plan build wall along u.s.-mexico border trump say mccain “not war hero,” mccain “a war hero capture like people weren’t captured.” trump indeed say “we situation inner city african american hispanic live hell it’s dangerous.” trump one high-profile “birthers” question whether obama u.s citizen.

earlier campaign trump say woman receive illegal abortion subject “some sort punishment.” reverse statement several hour later widespread criticism side abortion right issue amend statement say doctor woman punished.

this correct key difference nixon release tax presidential candidate year reelected.

presidential candidate legal obligation release return long tradition sake transparency trump cite pending internal revenue service audit even though first president release tax nixon middle audit moreover trump release tax return longer audit accord attorney.

pence correct raw number regard education spending incorrect figure adjust inflation.

pence propose plan improve road “that rely borrow draw state reserve account gimmick reach advertised billion sticker price,” ap reported “in end get fraction indiana’s republican-controlled legislature balk much money set aside local government come local tax hold state reserve already suppose returned.”

clinton has say would expand obama’s executive action immigration advocate comprehensive immigration reform include pathway citizenship. but also support enhanced border security immigration proposal include “humane target effective” enforcement focus immigration resources detain deport “who pose threat public safety.”

[update hack email release oct show clinton apparently say pay closed-door speech to brazilian bank “my dream hemispheric common market open trade open borders,” green energy.

the clinton campaign refuse authenticate hack email campaign manager robby mook say oct cbs “face nation” interview clinton “talking integrate green energy north south america question ‘does hillary clinton support throw open borders?’ absolutely go everything fight protect interest worker country.”]

this correct clinton say support president obama’s decision accept syrian refugee fiscal year — and would support increase percent increase clinton yet disclose plan new fiscal year beyond.

this map show syrian refugee end united states.

maybe gop ticket precisely use word “great” “better,” kaine pretty much hit target here.

pence tell cnn week ago “i think it’s inarguable vladimir putin strong leader country barack obama been.” penny make remarks just trump assert putin “been leader far president leader.”

kaine repeat line recently earn hillary clinton three pinocchios credible analyst would cite bush tax cut play key role spur economic crash.

kaine put even starkly clinton clinton campaign try suggest income inequality exacerbate tax cut lead stagnation middle class spur excess borrowing leverage key component crash along lax regulation that’s real stretch give a housing bubble key trigger cause great recession complex debatable there’s debate it is wrong put bush tax cut top list.

this isn’t direct quote deport undocumented immigrant trump say “criminal illegal immigrants” likely refer undocumented immigrant convict crime “are go go over.”

among claim trump make aug phoenix rally remove illegally:

but trump also lay deportation priority speech among them: targeting at least million many million undocumented immigrant would subject swift removal half million undocumented people estimate live united states.

pence misconstrue an associated press report similar way donald trump earlier campaign.

the ap analyze state department record look specifically clinton’s meeting phone person people federal employee foreign government representative narrow denominator small subcategory people clinton meet secretary state since majority diplomatic work would involve representative foreign government addition ap report is base partial record release state department far reflect full scope people clinton meet secretary state.

the ap find people “more half,” donate clinton foundation “pledged commitment international programs.” donor collectively contribute much million ap reported representative least foreign government donate much million charity representative include number ap reported.

this wrong count january nearly million private-sector job create united state accord bureau labor statistic count job include government job figure million.

so kaine come million he’s count low point job obama’s presidency february start clock tally million private-sector job million overall jobs.

the last time check february year ago claim kaine try wipe year obama’s presidency.

moreover general matter regular reader know tend discount job-creation record president much record due economic force beyond president’s control.

mark zandi respect economist moody’s analytics issue report say trump’s economic plan fully implement million job would disappear income would stagnate debt would explode stock price would plummet compare anticipate increase million job current obama administration policy another report zandi also say clinton able fully implement economic plan economy would create additional million job first four year presidency combine anticipated job creation current law add million jobs.

but report highly skeptical either candidate would able get plan congress even republican-controlled one trump presidency many trump’s position departure gop principles even report say u.s economy would likely suffer trump presidency report issue june moody’s issue updated report would reflect additional policy announce trump include revise tax plan report say trump’s trade policy would especially damaging.)

pence make sound like u.s taxpayer money use too-high estimate international sanction nuclear program iran billion dollar asset freeze foreign bank around globe sanction lift theory fund would unlocked.

but treasury department estimate iran fulfills obligation would billion leave much money obligate illiquid project china part central bank iran say number actually billion billion.

trump call north atlantic treaty organization obsolete say want get rid ask specifically washington post march want pull nato say “i don’t want pull nato set different time nato set richer country we’re rich country anymore think nato concept good good first evolved.” trump argue “distribution costs” change noted trump frequently overstate burden united states.

kaine refer trump’s book “the america deserve,” make comparison social security say wanted privatize program “the worker america force invest sixth wage huge ponzi scheme pyramid make paper-mache.”

trump added book “privatization would good u stand today percent woman social security live poverty.”

but book publish year ago campaign trail trump say want “keep social security intact.… i’m go cut it.” specific plan program however vague campaign say “the key preserve social security program benefit aarp member economy robust growing.”

for social security allegation ponzi scheme see fact checker’s guide critical question program.

this zombie claim won’t go away award three pinocchios fact checker repeatedly debunk presidential election.

indeed number ship oct low count since ship lot change year include need capacity ship it’s matter modern nuclear-powered fleet carrier versus gunboat small warship year ago push ship reagan era build navy level longer exist ship era retiring.

this talk point poor way depict country’s naval fleet need gunboat aircraft carrier military budget fleet needs historical circumstance much different reprises gop talk point campaign it’s correct obama substitute different system recommendation then-defense secretary robert gate republican gate fact recommend original plan president george w bush decide new system implement obama effective less costly timely bush plan.

gates memoir note obama administration stumble fail lay diplomatic groundwork shift look “like bunch bumble fools,” bush plan already run trouble prague warsaw likely would reject parliament country “the polish czech government relieved,” wrote.

“i sincerely believe new program well accord political reality europe effective emerge iranian threat,” gate add “while certainly state department white house believe third site europe incompatible russian ‘reset,’ defense making russian happy wasn’t exactly to-do list.”

in fact gate say russian quickly conclude obama plan even worse perspective eventually might capability could use russian intercontinental missiles.

“how ironic u.s critic new approach portray big concession russians,” gate add sardonically “it would nice hear critic washington career say well got wrong.”

trump walk back particular claim kaine cite “wages high.” course trump flip-flopped minimum wage least five time since august consistently contradict statement make hard track exactly stand issue give time trump’s stance matter august support “raising federal level believe state set minimum wage appropriate state.”

during november republican primary debate trump ask whether “sympathetic protesters’ cause since wage work year.” full answer part kaine quote bold:

days later trump clarify refer whether would increase minimum wage would raise would “too high,” said.

kaine correctly note penny congressman vote raise minimum wage make claim context abortion choose whether abortion right poll support fact show young adults’ view abortion right elder — unlike issue like marijuana gay marriage young people liberal.

among adult age percent say abortion legal most cases percent say illegal case accord pew research center poll similar age percent support abortion percent oppose age percent support percent opposed).

“partial-birth abortion” usually use refer later-term abortion use specific fetus-extraction method.

clinton say support ban late-term abortion include partial-birth abortion long health life mother protect senator clinton oppose partial-birth abortion act include health exception.

earlier year clinton say “on record favor late pregnancy regulation would exceptions life health mother.”

trump indeed say country south korea japan saudi arabia nuclear weapon nuclear proliferation inevitable trump say country like japan south korea would “better off” arm nuclear weapon order defend north korea trump say considers nuclear weapon last resort though would “rule anything out” regard use.

for example cnn town hall march trump ask “so say japan yes it’s fine get nuclear weapon south korea well saudi arabia say want too?”

trump answer “can honest it’s go happen anyway it’s go happen anyway it’s question time they’re go start get rid entirely many country already china pakistan many country russia many country right them.”

this odd inaccurate comment russia-georgia war take place clinton still u.s senator bush’s secretary state condoleezza rice lodge protest whatever diplomatic pressure bush team put russia georgia abandon president obama elect administration decide pursue ill-fated “reset.”

4626,"How Gary Johnson's Vote Percentages Will Affect Libertarian Party Ballot Access, State By State","There has been a lot of weight placed in Libertarian expectations and hopes for the results for Gary Johnson next Tuesday in terms of getting 5 percent nationally, which will make the Party's next presidential candidate eligible for a category of federal election funds.

While saying things both concise and accurate about ballot access laws in America, which vary state by state in this here federal union, is difficult, you have often heard, including from Gary Johnson himself, that getting that 5 percent will help the Party with ballot access as well.

Technically, the national result, whatever it is, in and of itself has no effect at all on ballot access anywhere but Georgia. (There, a 20 percent result nationally wins petition-free access.)

Every other state's ballot access laws, if vote percents affect them at all, are dictated only by the percentages gained in that state.

That said, under most imaginable circumstances a national 5 percent will mean that the Party also did historically well in lots of individual states also.

What follows, derived from this state-by-state chart from the invaluable Ballot Access News edited by Richard Winger, is a list of what the Libertarian Party will get in terms of automatic, petition-free ballot access if certain vote percentages in that state are hit. A huge proportion of the Libertarian Party's time and effort goes to petitioning for access, so these accomplishments are a big deal for small parties.

It's important to note that any such earned automatic ballot access is not eternal, and in many cases applies only to the next election, 2018, not even to the next presidential election. Below I specify which states get that access for just 2018 or for both 2018 and 2020.

Again, all these vote percentages are in the states in question, not national. In almost all cases, it is not just the presidential ticket hitting this percentage that wins the prize, but any office the entire state is voting for. Thus, the Party can re-win the access in 2018 for 2020 with any office voted on statewide, even though there is not a presidential race in 2018.

Now, the percentages and what they get the Party, and where:

• 0.5 percent gets the Libertarian Party full ballot access without need to spend time and money on petitioning for 2018 in Michigan and New Mexico.

• 1 percent gets the Libertarian Party full ballot access without need to spend time and money on petitioning for 2018 in Kansas, Maryland, Nevada, and Wisconsin.

It would earn such access in both 2018 and 2020 in Oregon.

It would earn such access only for the president slot in 2020 in Connecticut.

• 2 percent gets the Libertarian Party full ballot access without need to spend time and money on petitioning for 2018 in Iowa.

It would earn such access in both 2018 and 2020 in Kentucky, Missouri, Montana, North Carolina, and Utah.

• 2.5 percent gets the Libertarian Party full ballot access without need to spend time and money on petitioning for 2018 in Oklahoma and Washington D.C. [Correction: D.C.'s standard technically is a hard 7,500 votes, which tends to be around that percentage.]

• 3 percent gets the Libertarian Party full ballot access without need to spend time and money on petitioning for 2018 in Arkansas, Idaho, and Massachusetts.

It would earn such access in both 2018 and 2020 in Ohio. [Correction: Since Johnson is on the Ohio ballot technically as an independent this year, not with the L.P. banner, it will be meaningless for Ohio access, alas.]

It would earn such access only for the president slot in 2020 in Alaska.

• 5 percent gets the Libertarian Party full ballot access without need to spend time and money on petitioning for 2018 in North Dakota, Tennessee, and Texas.

It would earn such access in both 2018 and 2020 in Arizona, Louisiana, Minnesota, [correction: Minnesota was mistakenly left off in original post], Nebraska, Rhode Island, and Washington state.

Some states have even higher hurdles to jump for that state's vote totals for president (or other offices voted on statewide) to earn automatic ballot access, or other special cases. (Election law is hard.)

And a group of states give third parties no special ballot access benefits no matter how well the presidential candidate does. Those states are: California, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, South Carolina, South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming.

Five percent nationally would be an amazing thing for the Johnson campaign and the Libertarian Party. But what really matters for ballot access moving forward is what happens state by state.","How Gary Johnson's Vote Percentages Will Affect Libertarian Party Ballot Access, State By State There has been a lot of weight placed in Libertarian expectations and hopes for the results for Gary Johnson next Tuesday in terms of getting 5 percent nationally, which will make the Party's next presidential candidate eligible for a category of federal election funds.

2996,"White House report offers more on NSA spying on Americans' calls, with Patriot Act set to expire","With debate gearing up over the coming expiration of the Patriot Act surveillance law, the Obama administration on Saturday unveiled a 6-year-old report examining the once-secret program to collect information on Americans' calls and emails.

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence publicly released the redacted report following a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by the New York Times. The basics of the National Security Agency program had already been declassified, but the lengthy report includes some new details about the secrecy surrounding it.

President George W. Bush authorized the ""President's Surveillance Program"" in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. The review was completed in July 2009 by inspectors general from the Justice Department, Pentagon, CIA, NSA and Office of the Director of National Intelligence.

They found that while many senior intelligence officials believe the program filled a gap by increasing access to international communications, others including FBI agents, CIA analysts and managers ""had difficulty evaluating the precise contribution of the PSP to counterterrorism efforts because it was most often viewed as one source among many available analytic and intelligence-gathering tools in these efforts.""

Critics of the phone records program, which allows the NSA to hunt for communications between terrorists abroad and U.S. residents, argue it has not proven to be an effective counterterrorism tool. They also say an intelligence agency has no business possessing the deeply personal records of Americans. Many favor a system under which the NSA can obtain court orders to query records held by the phone companies.

The Patriot Act expires on June 1, and Senate Republicans have introduced a bill that would allow continued collection of call records of nearly every American. The legislation would reauthorize sections of the Patriot Act, including the provision under which the NSA requires phone companies to turn over the ""to and from"" records of most domestic landline calls.

After the program was disclosed in 2013 by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, President Barack Obama and many lawmakers called for legislation to end that collection, but a bill to do so failed last year. Proponents had hoped that the expiration of the Patriot Act provisions on June 1 would force consideration of such a measure.

A bipartisan group of House members has been working on such legislation, dubbed the USA Freedom Act. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Friday that Obama is pleased the efforts are restarting in the House.

""Hopefully, the next place where Democrats and Republicans will turn their attention and try to work together is on this issue of putting in place important reforms to the Patriot Act,"" Earnest said.

If no legislation is passed, the Patriot Act provisions would expire. That would affect not only the NSA surveillance but other programs used by the FBI to investigate domestic crimes, which puts considerable pressure on lawmakers to pass some sort of extension.","White House report offers more on NSA spying on Americans' calls, with Patriot Act set to expire With debate gearing up over the coming expiration of the Patriot Act surveillance law, the Obama administration on Saturday unveiled a 6-year-old report examining the once-secret program to collect information on Americans' calls and emails.

5957,Teens walk free after gang-rape conviction,"Teens walk free after gang-rape conviction Judge said group who left girl, 14, for dead appeared 'repentant' Published: 20 mins ago 
(Deutsche Welle) In the wake of the news that a group of teenagers were unlikely to see any real punishment for gang-raping a 14-year-old girl and leaving her for dead, citizens of the German city of Hamburg called for new rules regarding violent crime committed by minors. On Monday, an online petition calling for the teens to see jail time had garnered some 21,000 signatures.

According to an update on the Change.org petition, state prosecutors in Hamburg have said they will explore a way to make sure that the teens are punished despite laws that make it difficult for minors to be prosecuted and sentenced to detention.","Teens walk free after gang-rape conviction Teens walk free after gang-rape conviction Judge said group who left girl, 14, for dead appeared 'repentant' Published: 20 mins ago 
(Deutsche Welle) In the wake of the news that a group of teenagers were unlikely to see any real punishment for gang-raping a 14-year-old girl and leaving her for dead, citizens of the German city of Hamburg called for new rules regarding violent crime committed by minors. On Monday, an online petition calling for the teens to see jail time had garnered some 21,000 signatures.

(CNN) Donald Trump is winning! I'm not talking about the GOP presidential nomination, but about his success in controlling the way the media has covered him in the campaign.

Trump hosting ""Saturday Night Live"" this past weekend was a prime example. Last week the media coverage of Trump was almost exclusively focused on his upcoming appearance on SNL: Would Trump be funny? Could this hurt his campaign? Would a person yell out during the live show that Trump was a racist in protest at Trump's past comments about Latinos? And the list goes on. (I contributed to that coverage with this piece and with CNN appearances.)

Well, the Trump-helmed ""SNL"" has passed.

This has prompted many in the media to now ask: Was the show funny? Did any of the sketches make Trump look unpresidential? What was the point of Larry David calling Trump a racist during the show's opening monologue?

When the media focuses on these types of questions, I can only imagine that Trump must be smiling like a master puppeteer, making his marionettes (the media) dance. This is Trump's world, and the media are merely players in it.

Every time the media focuses on events such as Trump on ""SNL"" or his Twitter feuds and his fights with Fox News' hosts, the media is not pressing Trump on his understanding of public policy issues. And that's a big win for the master media manipulator Trump.

When Trump, or any presidential candidate for that matter, talks in detail about political issues, it's generally divisive.

In fact when Trump unveiled his tax plan in late September, that led many in the media to focus on whether his proposal was feasible, would it be revenue neutral as he claimed, was it a giveaway to the wealthiest Americans, etc.? It also gave his political opponents, such as Jeb Bush , fodder to attack Trump on a policy issue that could attract some GOP primary voters to his candidacy.

But potentially the biggest downside to Trump talking nuanced policy issues is that he has yet to impress us that he truly has a grasp of them, especially those outside the area of economics.

This is a guy who, when asked on ""Meet the Press"" in August where he gets his military advice from, responded: ""Well, I watch the shows. I mean, I really see a lot of great -- you know, when you watch your show and all of the other shows."" In Trump's defense, you can learn a lot about fighting if you watch ""The Real Housewives of New Jersey.""

And on Sunday, when asked by CNN's Jake Tapper how he would handle ISIS, Trump responded, ""we've got to hit ISIS hard ... hit their source of wealth, which is the oil. "" But when Tapper pressed him for details on how he would go about hitting ISIS ""hard,"" Trump coyly stated, ""I hate to say specifically because ... I'd hate to give up all my information up front.""

If Trump had been a former Army general or had even the slightest experience in foreign policy, you might be able to feel confident he truly has a plan. But let's be honest, you get the sense Trump simply hasn't given this much thought.

So what does Trump do to cover for his weakness? He steers the media away from topics he perceives as being detrimental to his campaign into areas where he's strongest. And who can blame him? Why not play to your strengths?

Plus, let's be blunt, most people are more interested in hearing about a celebrity-infused Twitter brawl than about wonky policy details. So for the media, going along with covering Trump the personality over the potential policymaker has an upside.

Between now and the February 1 Iowa GOP caucus, we will see even more of Trump trying to steer the media away from policy issues. Maybe in December we will see Trump show up on ""The Big Bang Theory"" as Sheldon's long-lost uncle. Perhaps in January, The Donald will serve as a guest judge on ""The Voice"" or don a beard and appear on ""Duck Dynasty."" And don't be surprised if Trump picks a Twitter fight with Kanye West, Miley Cyrus and a slew of Kardashians.

With the Iowa caucus only a little over two months away, it's the media's call: Let Trump pull the strings, or cut them and dance on your own? Letting Trump remain in control probably means higher ratings, but it also likely means a less informed electorate when it comes to Trump's views on policy issues.

3416,Republicans have a weapon to stop Obama recess appointment,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is bent on refusing to consider any nominee President Obama may submit to succeed late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. And if he doesn’t give ground, Obama may have only one option for an end-run: a recess appointment.

But Republicans can rest easy: GOP leaders have an ace up their sleeve.

The truth is, it doesn’t take much to prevent a recess appointment, as long as congressional leaders are watching the calendar. Closely.

If you’re trying to block the president from making one to the Supreme Court, all the Senate has to do is commence a session every three days. Because the Senate is only truly in recess after that three-day period.

The Constitution actually requires the House and Senate to meet every three days unless there’s an agreement between the two bodies to skip, and go on recess. With the battle over a Supreme Court pick heating up, don’t expect that to happen in the near future.

All McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., have to do is schedule what are called “pro-forma” sessions at three-day intervals for the rest of the year. Pro-forma sessions are brief meetings of the House and Senate, lasting but a minute or two – and sometimes, a matter of seconds. They help the House and Senate comport with the constitutional mandate of huddling every three days – even if they aren’t really doing anything.

The House and Senate don’t conduct any business during these confabs. In congressional parlance, they’re sometimes referred to as just “gavel-in, gavel-out.” No votes. No speeches. Few words are uttered at all.

The phrase “pro-forma” is derived from Latin, meaning “formality.”

Congress doesn’t consider itself adjourned or on recess if it’s “meeting” every three days. And that’s all it takes to block a recess appointment for the rest of the president’s term.

In 2011 and 2012, Democrats still controlled the Senate. But Republicans ran the show in the House. The GOP-controlled House refused to agree to an adjournment resolution in an effort to block Obama from scuttling a Senate filibuster of his nominees to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Thus, the House and Senate met every three days.

In early 2012, the president made four recess appointments in the window between the three-day pro-forma sessions. But the Supreme Court later voided those appointments. The court said that was the point of the three-day sessions. The Senate was indeed in session. The Supreme Court ruled 9-0 against the administration’s brazen attempt to slip in appointments between the sessions every three days.

Ironically, Scalia, Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito wrote a concurring opinion to the NLRB case. They argued “that recess appointments will remain a powerful weapon in the President’s arsenal.” They added it was “unfortunate because the recess power is an anachronism.”

When the roles were reversed, Democrats used the same tool.

For much of the final two years of President George W. Bush’s term, the Democrat-controlled Senate met every few days to block him from making a recess appointment.

In 2003, Senate Republicans blasted minority Democrats for holding up a number of judicial nominations. Democrats had particular trouble with the nomination of Judge Bill Pryor to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Georgia. Democrats didn’t like Pryor’s views on women’s issues and homosexuality. So they filibustered Pryor.

During a summertime adjournment (not amid the three-day, pro-forma theater discussed here), Bush went around the Senate and appointed Pryor without its advice and consent.

Democrats may try to force Republicans to take that vote this summer, too. But Republicans know that the best way to prevent a recess appointment later this year is to just meet every three days.

The GOP-controlled House refused to agree to an adjournment resolution in an effort to block Obama from scuttling a Senate filibuster of his nominees to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Thus, the House and Senate met every three days.

In early 2012, the president made four recess appointments in the window between the three-day pro-forma sessions. But the Supreme Court later voided those appointments. The court said that was the point of the three-day sessions. The Senate was indeed in session. The Supreme Court ruled 9-0 against the administration’s brazen attempt to slip in appointments between the sessions every three days.

Ironically, Scalia, Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito wrote a concurring opinion to the NLRB case. They argued “that recess appointments will remain a powerful weapon in the President’s arsenal.” They added it was “unfortunate because the recess power is an anachronism.”

When the roles were reversed, Democrats used the same tool.

For much of the final two years of President George W. Bush’s term, the Democrat-controlled Senate met every few days to block him from making a recess appointment.

In 2003, Senate Republicans blasted minority Democrats for holding up a number of judicial nominations. Democrats had particular trouble with the nomination of Judge Bill Pryor to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Georgia. Democrats didn’t like Pryor’s views on women’s issues and homosexuality. So they filibustered Pryor.

During a summertime adjournment (not amid the three-day, pro-forma theater discussed here), Bush went around the Senate and appointed Pryor without its advice and consent.

Democrats may try to force Republicans to take that vote this summer, too. But Republicans know that the best way to prevent a recess appointment later this year is to just meet every three days.

3802,5 key questions about shutting down Gitmo,"President Obama released a plan from the Pentagon on Tuesday that spelled out ways the United States can close the terrorist detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and send the detainees elsewhere, including to facilities in the United States. Here are some of the key details about the plan and Guantanamo.

Where could the detainees go in the United States?

The plan says the Pentagon team inspected 13 different facilities inside the United States that could accommodate the detainees, but it did not name the sites. Even so, Defense Secretary Ash Carter and other officials have named several potential locations, starting with the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., and the naval brig at Charleston, S.C.

""That does not mean those sites will be chosen,"" Carter said last August.

Other potential sites include two prisons in Colorado, including the federal high security prison in Florence.

Convicted terrorists are already held in the Florence prison, including Zacarias Moussaoui, the only person convicted in civilian court for the Sept. 11, 2011, attacks; Faisal Shahzad, who tried to blow up a car bomb in New York's Times Square in 2010; and Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of the 1993 bombing of New York's World Trade Center.

Elected officials from virtually every state with a facility that could house the Guantanamo detainees have protested, saying that moving the detainees there could jeopardize the safety of their residents.

Why can't the president just close Guantanamo?

In the recent effort last December, Congress approved a spending bill for 2016 that specifically bars Obama from closing the Guantanamo Bay detention facility or spending money on a new facility to house terrorists. Obama signed the bill despite provisions he didn't like, such as those about Guantanamo, to avoid a government shutdown.

A defense authorization bill Obama signed last year also included language prohibiting from closing Guantanamo and moving the detainees.

The plan released by Obama Tuesday was meant to show Congress how the prison could be closed and how much it would cost.

How many detainees remain in Guantanamo?

There are now 91 terrorist suspects remaining at the prison. Of those, 35 have been identified as being eligible for transfer out of the prison and to other countries, the Pentagon report said.

At one time during the Bush administration, there were almost 800 detainees at Guantanamo. More than 500 were transferred by the previous administration and 147 by Obama, Pentagon documents show.

Where have the detainees gone?

Since Oct. 1, 2014, Pentagon records show, 58 detainees have been transferred to Afghanistan, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Estonia, Georgia, Ghana, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Mauritania, Montenegro, Morocco, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, United Kingdom and Uruguay.

Oman, a small nation on the Persian Gulf, has taken the most — 20.

Who decides which detainees are eligible to leave?

That work is done by the Periodic Review Board, an interagency group including representatives from the Pentagon, Department of Homeland Security, Justice Department, State Department, the Office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.

The board uses current intelligence and other information to determine if ""the continued detention of the detainee remains necessary to protect against a continuing significant threat to the security of the United States,"" Pentagon records show.

The administration hopes to finish reviewing all detainees by this fall and to determine if any more are eligible for transfer.","5 key questions about shutting down Gitmo President Obama released a plan from the Pentagon on Tuesday that spelled out ways the United States can close the terrorist detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and send the detainees elsewhere, including to facilities in the United States.

1145,Democratic debate: 5 takeaways,"Flint, Michigan (CNN) It was no Republican debate -- nobody talked about the size of their hands or made up demeaning nicknames -- but Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders were ready for action Sunday night.

Personal frustration peeked through as Clinton unloaded new attacks on Sanders over his opposition to the auto bailout and Sanders portrayed Clinton as a candidate straight out of Wall Street central casting.

Sunday was also '90s night, as the candidates essentially re-litigated major political battles of the era -- including NAFTA, the assault weapons ban and crime bill -- through modern eyes.

The debate came two days before Michigan's primary -- a key test of whether Sanders can expand his appeal to a broader and more diverse electorate -- and was shaped by the concerns of voters in this city that is still struggling with a water crisis for which local, state and federal officials share the blame.

Here are five takeaways from Sunday's debate:

Sanders waved, shouted, eye-rolled, baited and goaded his way through the debate.

Clinton laid into his opposition to the auto industry bailout. That measure was part of a broader rescue of the financial industry, a point Sanders was only too happy to make by saying: ""If you are talking about the Wall Street bailout, where some of your friends destroyed the economy —""

And then Clinton said: ""If you're going to talk, tell the whole story.""

Sanders railed against the bailout, saying that he decided to ""let the billionaires themselves bail out Wall Street -- it shouldn't be the middle class"" -- when Clinton tried to interject again.

""Could I finish? You'll have your turn,"" he said.

He showed his frustration with Clinton again later, saying: ""Can I finish, please? All right?""

The exchange demonstrated a new level of comfort with the hand-to-hand combat of presidential campaigns. But it was also a risky move, making him sound potentially patronizing or dismissive of a candidate who could become the first female president.

This from a candidate who entered the race bragging about never running a negative ad. Sanders might keep their disputes focused on differences of policy -- but at times Sunday night, it looked and sounded personal.

When Clinton was asked about fracking, she launched into a nuanced answer that gave credence to localities, state governments, and more. Her bottom line: There wouldn't be many places where it would be OK under her.

Sanders had a much simpler answer. ""No,"" he said. He doesn't support it. And he said he doesn't care about all the Democratic governors who support it.

This, in a nutshell, is the difference between them. She has nuanced positions that look at the breadth of opinion across the country. She's also keenly aware of the limitations of government, and strains to keep her positions within those limits -- part of what she calls her ""responsibility gene.""

Sanders has definitive positions that take a look at his ideology. That's the Democrat's choice: nuance or no nuance.

This same difference showed up when the two delved into the Flint water crisis at the debate's outset.

Clinton's big move on stage -- her news-making comment at the debate's outset -- was one she'd resisted for months, arguing it was simplistic. But she went for it Sunday night, saying she agrees with Sanders in saying Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder needs to go. ""I agree the governor should resign or be recalled,"" she said.

""First thing you do is say, people are not paying a water bill for poison water. And that is retroactive,"" he said.

So she readied an attack that Sanders didn't seem prepared for, going at the Vermont senator for opposing the auto bailout.

""The money was there and had to be released in order to save the auto industry and 4 million jobs and to begin the restructuring,"" Clinton said. ""I voted to save the auto industry. He voted against the money that ended up saving the auto industry. I think that is a pretty big difference.""

Then, she ticked off a list of states where she thinks that vote will hurt Sanders.

""Given the terrible pressures that the auto industry was under and that the middle class of this state and Ohio and Indiana and Illinois and Wisconsin and Missouri and other places in the Midwest were facing, I think it was the right decision to heed what President-elect Obama asked us to do,"" she said. ""You were either for saving the auto industry or against it. I voted to save the auto industry and I'm very glad that I did.""

The damage was done: When Clinton dropped the auto bailout bomb, the audience audibly ooooohed, highlighting the potency of that argument in the home of the U.S. auto industry.

But he had his tone-deaf moments, sparking outrage on social media when he seemed to suggest that black people grow up poor and in ghettos and white people do not -- a particular eye-raiser because he'd been asked about his racial blind spots.

""When you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto, you don't know what it's like to be poor,"" Sanders said.

For Sanders, this is the central challenge facing his campaign. Clinton blew him out across the South among African-Americans, and Sanders can't withstand her doing so again in big, Midwestern states.

Michigan's March 8 primary will be a key test of whether Sanders can win with a more diverse electorate. The following week -- when Ohio, Illinois, Missouri, Florida and North Carolina vote -- will be his moment of truth.

Near the end of the debate, Sanders also cracked a joke about boosting funding for mental health, saying that ""when you watch these Republican debates, you know why we need to invest in mental health.""

It was the right target (Republicans) and the right audience (liberals) -- but perhaps the wrong topic, as he again risked appearing insensitive.

One for the base

The debate was a strong sign that both candidates still see room to gain or lose ground among liberal voters. They spent so much time jockeying to get to each other's left that there was virtually no talk of Republicans at all.

Clinton and Sanders defended government spending and intervention, teachers' unions, gun control, clean energy programs and efforts to fight climate change. They talked about a beefed-up role for the Environmental Protection Agency.

There was no talk about foreign policy, the deficit, entitlements -- subjects always front-and-center at Republican debates.

It's a clear sign that the Sanders camp doesn't see the Democratic nominating contest ending anytime soon, with liberal bastions like New York (which votes in April) and California (June) available as opportunities to rack up lots of delegates.

Increasingly, Clinton is eyeing the general election on the campaign trail -- axing her usual shots at Sanders from her stump speech, focusing on the economy and laying into Republican front-runner Donald Trump. That wasn't apparent Sunday night.","Democratic debate: 5 takeaways Flint, Michigan (CNN) It was no Republican debate -- nobody talked about the size of their hands or made up demeaning nicknames -- but Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders were ready for action Sunday night.

5478,Europe or Russia: Could Moldova's presidential election determine its future?,"Europe or Russia: Could Moldova's presidential election determine its future? Moldova goes to the polls for the first time in 25 years to elect a new president Moldova goes to the polls to elect a new president at a time of tensions between pro-Russian and pro-EU camps. 

A woman walks by electoral posters in Chisinau, Moldova. Moldovans will vote for a president on Oct. 30 i n an election, which could move the former Soviet republic closer to Europe or to Russia. Photo: AP 
On the last Sunday of October, presidential elections will be held in the Republic of Moldova. This small state in southeastern Europe does not rank among the major international players, ye t its significance should not be underestimated . 
Moldova is located on the border between the post-Soviet space and the European Union , and over the past 25 years, its territory, wedged between Romania and Ukraine, has more than once been an arena of both competition and cooperation between the West and Russia. The emergence of the post-Soviet Moldavian state also produced the Transnistrian conflict , which had outsized influence in the development of Russian policies toward newly independent former Soviet republics and the relations between Russia and the European Union.
Between the East and the West Moldova is a strategic partner of the EU. It was the first state the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) to receive visa-free travel to the EU for its citizens. Additionally, it has special political and historical-cultural ties with Romania.
As experts Dmitri Furman and Cristina Batog wrote, “of all the titular nations of the former Soviet, and later, post-Soviet republics, the Moldovans possess the most uncertain, contradictory mentality,” and the question of whether they are part of the larger, divided Romanian nation or a separate Moldovan ethnicity has not been decided yet, either on the personal or political level. 
As a result, there is a serious competition within the country between two national-state projects, “Moldavianism” and “Unionism” (or “Romanianism”). This situation would be unimaginable in other countries with separatist regions, such as Georgia or Azerbaijan .
Also read: "" Will Moldova become a new flashpoint for Russia and Europe? "" At the same time, Chișinău officially declares its neutrality and, unlike Tbilisi and Kiev, has not forced its relations with NATO . This approach is not least due to the presence of a considerable and stable part of the electorate that is interested in preserving ties with Russia, as well as to the problems concerning the Gagauzian Autonomy, whose population also favors Eurasian integration. 
Nevertheless, Moldova rejected the federalization project proposed by Moscow in 2003 as part of a resolution to the Transnistrian situation. At the time, the republic was led not by a coalition that favored closer ties with the EU, but by the Communist Party headed by Vladimir Voronin, which came to power advocating rapprochement with Russia and the Union State of Russia and Belarus.
Political turmoil The Oct. 30 presidential election is an important milestone in the country’s history. For the first time in 20 years, the president will be elected by popular vote. Since 2000, the head of state has been elected by the members of parliament, but in March of this year, Moldova’s Constitutional Court repealed the previous amendments to the Republic’s Constitution that gave this power to the parliament. 
The problems with the country’s electoral system had been known for some time. After Voronin left office in 2009, the country went for three years without a legitimate president. The parliament could not reach a consensus on the country’s next leader, who had to be elected by a three-fifths majority of legislators. Moldova was governed by the speaker of parliament who was given the status of “acting president.” Only in March 2012 did Nicolae Timofti gain the deputies’ support and was elected president.
Crises and mistrust of the main institutions of power have become a chronic disease in post-Soviet Moldova. In September 2015, a scandal broke out when multi-millions were withdrawn from the country’s three leading banks and transferred offshore. 
Mass protests ensued, and some observers were quickly to refer to the moment as a “Chișinău maidan” after the protests that brought down the government of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich . The protests had the effect of uniting those who wanted closer integration with Romania and those who wanted closer integration with the EU while alienating those inclined to deepen ties with Russia. 
The decision on returning to direct election of the president was adopted, to a large extent, under the influence of that social-political turbulence. The election was considered an attempt to establish political legitimacy against the backdrop of growing mistrust of the other governmental institutions.
Candidates and positions The favorites in the election are Igor Dodon, leader of the Socialist Party, and former Minister of Education (2012–2015) Maia Sandu. Four days before the election, Marian Lupu, a democrat and former speaker of the parliament (2005–2009 and 2010–2013) withdrew his candidacy. All the leading candidates engaged in bashing their opponents and promoting their own domestic policy agendas, they also have vastly different foreign policy values. 
Dodon is pro-Russian and favors Eurasian integration, Sandu supports deeper cooperation with the EU. Lupu explained his withdrawal from the campaign because of the necessity to consolidate the supporters of the “European choice.” 
Also read: "" Revealing the post-Soviet identity complex in Transnistria "" Under close scrutiny though, such differentiation is mostly artificial. The same Dodon, who denounced the Moldova–European Union Association Agreement early in the discussions over it spoke more cautiously as the campaign went on, promoting instead a tri-lateral format of cooperation between Brussels, C hișinău and Moscow). 
Dodon, who is also supportive of a flexible approach to Transdnistria, was the Deputy Minister and then Minister for Economy and Trade when Moldova and Ukraine tried to carry out an “economic defreezing” of the region in March 2006. At that time, Ukraine decided to ban Transnistrian goods from traveling across its border unless they were documented by Moldova’s customs office.
In Tiraspol, that step was regarded as the introduction of a joint Ukrainian–Moldavian economic blockade of Transnistria, since goods could not flow out any other way. This was, of course, an exaggeration, but it strengthened the already powerful pro-Russian sentiments on the left bank of the Dniester. Obviously, Moldova’s Ministry of Economy and Trade and its key officials, including Dodon, played a role in the decision.
Should the pro-European camp suffer a defeat in the election, neither the country’s foreign policy nor its position towards the settlement of the Transnistrian conflict is likely to shift substantially. Unlike Kiev, both the pro-Russian and pro-European camps in Chișinău are interested in preventing a large-scale confrontation with Moscow. 
As for the “Romanian factor,” Bucharest has considerably changed its rhetoric under the new president Klaus Iohannis. The political focus shifted from propagating the idea of the “great union,” as phrased by the former Romanian leader Traian Băsescu, to building economic ties not only with the Republic of Moldova but also with Transnistria. In this, Bucharest is influenced to some extent by the European Union, which against the background of the conflict in Donbass and the migration crisis, is not interested in the escalation of another standoff close to its borders.

4069,"Solemn, stupefied, families in Kathmandu after earthquake","Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) The clamor and chaos of the previous day has dissipated by the time we arrive at Kathmandu's only airport. The mad rush of 24 hours previously, in those first confusing, cacophonous hours following the 7.8-magnitude earthquake near the Nepali capital, had died down. Now, families sit, camped out, silent and patiently waiting, but for now abandoned.

At the airport, at passport control, we meet a Nepalese man, who is unable to contact his family. They live in a village 20 km from the epicenter. He also has two cousins on Everest, he says. He has no way to reach any of them.

Stepping out of the terminal building, the devastation is apparent. It is an overwhelming introduction to this city that, less than 48 hours ago, was hit by the worst earthquake this country has experienced in 80 years.

The death toll has skipped past 3,000 and climbs, inexorably. Taking into account the fact that many rural areas, just as badly affected but isolated and vulnerable, have yet to be evaluated, the human cost is staggering.

Across town the bus station is a hive of activity as scores try urgently to leave the city, to make it out to the outlying areas so badly affected by this quake. Communications are down and so many here are desperate to make it out to their stricken families, and discover their fate.

The scene is repeated at every gas station; snaking lines of Indian-made Tata cars, and motorcycles, waiting to fill up. People are clambering aboard buses, into cars, trying to get as far away from this devastation as possible.

Remaining inside Kathmandu, neighbors stare forlornly at their former homes, now collapsed piles of rubble. We visit a Montessori school, mercifully empty as the children had the Saturday off. A seven-story building behind it, however, was home to a small church, and housed a congregation of between 40 and 50 when tragedy occurred.

The pastor's son Nakul Tamang clambers up a ladder, looking for an entrance into the ruined facade, looking to retrieve his father, not knowing if he will find him alive or dead. Rescue teams stop him before he reaches the top. The building is not secure, but Tamang doesn't care. ""It's sad, it's hard,"" he says. Six bodies had already been pulled from the concrete and steel wreckage.

A nearby five-story structure has collapsed in on itself. It was pink, with wrought balconies. Now it is pancaked, reduced to a third of its height and a mess of rubble and reinforced steel. One woman has been pulled out of the wreckage, and rescuers continue to work in a precarious hollow scooped out from the fallen bricks. Officials tell the onlookers that there is a chance that survivors may have been protected in a corridor as the building came down around them.

A day after the earthquake struck, they found a woman under the rubble. Unhurt; in shock, but alive. It is this hope that keeps Narayan Gurung going: the belief that his wife and 7-year-old are still alive. ""I raced here after the earthquake. I haven't slept for days,"" he says. Workers dig painstakingly, slowly removing piles of stone and debris. They spot someone's hair, but can't yet reach the body or tell if it's male or female.

Wherever there is rubble in this city, there is a police or military presence. They are not necessarily commanding the digs but they keep onlookers from getting too close, or directing traffic as best they can. For their part, the onlookers look shell shocked -- there is little outpouring of grief, no sobbing or wailing, but rather a solemn, dazed, collective sense of disbelief.

Tundikhel Park was, just two days ago, a vast, open green oasis in the city, but is now a mess of tents. Some have made their own, the army is setting up others. Metal bleacher-style seating has been set up, with dozens of people sitting, waiting, makeshift blue tarp tents pitched underneath. People bring in fresh fruit, and there are water sellers -- although clean bottled water is becoming hard to to find. People queue endlessly for food and water.

There is a mobile government field hospital here, and those treated wait listlessly outside, a collection of crushed hands, broken legs, strapped ankles. One little boy was hit by a falling brick. ""I felt something like a fire, and I ran, and then something hurt me a lot."" he says. ""I am still scared.""

And so is everybody else: those who survived clinging to those they love.","Solemn, stupefied, families in Kathmandu after earthquake Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) The clamor and chaos of the previous day has dissipated by the time we arrive at Kathmandu's only airport.

People bring in fresh fruit, and there are water sellers -- although clean bottled water is becoming hard to to find. People queue endlessly for food and water.

There is a mobile government field hospital here, and those treated wait listlessly outside, a collection of crushed hands, broken legs, strapped ankles. One little boy was hit by a falling brick. ""I felt something like a fire, and I ran, and then something hurt me a lot."" he says. ""I am still scared.""

And so is everybody else: those who survived clinging to those they love.","solemn stupefy family kathmandu earthquake kathmandu nepal cnn clamor chaos previous day dissipate time arrive kathmandu's airport mad rush hour previously first confuse cacophonous hour follow earthquake near nepali capital die family sit camp silent patiently wait abandoned.

Not a day goes by that we don’t miss Andrew Breitbart. But it’s days like today when we really feel his absence and wonder what could have been. Andrew Breitbart was right about a lot of things. But m n was he right about Anthony Weiner

As Twitchy told you , the FBI reportedly decided to reopen their probe into Hillary Clinton in light of emails discovered on one of Anthony Weiner’s devices.

3853,Just How Big Is The Asia Trade Deal Obama Wants? It's A Beast,"Just How Big Is The Asia Trade Deal Obama Wants? It's A Beast

One of the most basic facts about the Trans-Pacific Partnership is also the most important: It's huge.

The trade deal got over a big hurdle Friday when the Senate voted in favor of giving the Obama administration ""fast-track"" authority to negotiate the deal with Canada and 10 Asian nations.

That leaves the U.S. House, and it's unclear it has the votes yet. If it passes, though, TPP, which has angered many in the president's party, would be by far the largest free trade agreement the U.S. has in effect.

The 12 nations involved in TPP make up about 36 percent of global gross domestic product, or GDP, according to data from the International Monetary Fund. That sets the TPP well apart from the 14 free trade agreements the U.S. currently has in effect with 20 countries (to be fair, the U.S. accounts for nearly 23 percent of global GDP by itself).

Not only that, but these nations together account for about one-third of global trade, according to the Brookings Institution.

So the TPP stands apart from other trade agreements in its size. But that's only one dimension of its impact. Another way the TPP is gargantuan is tougher to quantify in a bar graph: its scope. It not only covers basic trade issues like tariffs, but also a variety of other areas like labor and environmental and intellectual property.

The size and scope of TPP matter because they are at the center of the debate. The Obama administration sees the deal's broad reach as positive — the agreement, the administration says, will open up the U.S. to all kinds of new markets and business.

Agribusiness companies, for example, are excited about having new avenues for their products. The labor and environmental provisions, the administration also argues, will force other nations to up their game on those issues, ""leveling the playing field.""

Not only that, but the TPP's size is all the more important for the one economic superpower that isn't included in it: China. One of the administration's top arguments for the deal is that in negotiating TPP, it ""writes the rules"" for trade with a large swath of eastern Asian countries before China can with its own trade agreements.

But opponents, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., worry about the sweep of the deal. Leaked chapters have intellectual property advocates, like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, worried it goes too far in areas like extending copyright laws and fair use rules. Doctors Without Borders has also argued the deal could make for more expensive generic drugs, restricting access to medicine for some consumers.

However, some wish the pact went further — environmental groups like the Sierra Club, for example, believe the provisions won't do enough to address overfishing.

But then, no one outside members of Congress, negotiators and a small group of cleared individuals has access to the pact, so it's hard to know exactly how far it will (or won't) go. And that is perhaps the source of the most tension in the TPP debate: that such a big deal is being negotiated behind closed doors.

If Congress grants the administration fast-track (also known as Trade Promotion Authority), it will mean two to four months for public comment before Congress gives the deal an up-or-down vote, with no amendments or debate.

The administration argues that this is unprecedented transparency for a trade deal. Opponents, however, believe it would be too little, too late in what has now been a seven-year negotiating process.","Just How Big Is The Asia Trade Deal Obama Wants?

One of the most basic facts about the Trans-Pacific Partnership is also the most important: It's huge.

The trade deal got over a big hurdle Friday when the Senate voted in favor of giving the Obama administration ""fast-track"" authority to negotiate the deal with Canada and 10 Asian nations.

7179,Clinton Is the Most Dangerous Person Alive – An Interview with Edward S. Herman,"2016 presidential campaign by Ann Garrison 
The just-concluded election revealed as much about the corporate media, which has broken every rule of journalism to support Hillary Clinton, and the fraudulence of much of the American Left, which turns out to have no real problem with war or capitalism, than it did about the candidates, themselves. Edward Herman is an exception, a genuine man of the Left. He says “a vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for war with Syria and Russia.” Clinton Is the Most Dangerous Person Alive – An Interview with Edward S. Herman by Ann Garrison 
“ The election of Hillary Clinton might threaten a democratic order as much as a Trump victory.” 
Ann Garrison: Earlier this year, you told me that you differ with Noam Chomsky, your co-author of Manufacturing Consent and other books, in that you plan to vote for the Green Party's presidential and vice presidential candidates Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka in the swing state of Pennsylvania. Are you still planning to do so? 
Edward S. Herman: Yes. 
AG: Can you explain why? 
ESH: Because the two duopoly candidates are dangerous to societal and international welfare and even survival. Hillary Clinton is a neo-liberal and pre-eminent war-monger. I think she is the most dangerous person living in the world today, given her highly likely election victory and her likely performance as president. She represents the corporate elite and military-industrial complex more clearly than Trump and she is a follow-on to Bush and Obama. She will pursue similar policies except for her somewhat more aggressive bent. 
Trump is a self-promoting windbag, racist and dangerous, unpredictable phony. We have a ghastly choice in these two. Jill Stein offers a protest opportunity, more so than not voting. On the line that either voting for Stein or not voting would constitute a vote for Trump, one might argue that a vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for war with Syria and Russia and a vote for Netanyahu (and hence for escalated violence in Palestine). 
AG: Hillary Clinton and John Podesta's e-mail has revealed that Hillary Clinton is well aware that the Saudi and Qatari rulers - not rogue elements - fund ISIS, and the same Saudi and Qatari rulers fund the Clinton Foundation. Throughout the last George Bush's presidency, there were innumerable headlines that ""Saudi oil sheikhs met with George Bush on his Crawford, Texas ranch."" What are your thoughts on that? 
ESH: Saudi Arabia is a US ally and an instrument of the warfare state. Hillary Clinton has treated its leaders warmly and she will continue to do so as president. The Clinton Foundation's receipt of money from Saudi and Qatari leaders is a first class conflict of interest and outrage, but the media have focused on the many less important abuses of Trump, helping cover over the outrages of their preferred candidate, Hillary Clinton, and her husband, Bill Clinton. 
AG: What do you think of Clinton's statement that she would make removing Bashar Al-Assad her top priority? And Trump's statement that he would not, because that would recklessly risk confrontation with Russia? 
ESH: Hillary Clinton has essentially promised to escalate war in Syria and is therefore promising to go to war with Russia as well. Diana Johnstone has made the case that Hillary Clinton plans to try to bring about ""regime change"" in Russia (cite). This is of course incredibly dangerous and would have aroused a really democratic media, but the existing media are part of the war system, hence Hillary Clinton's commitment to wars is essentially suppressed. Trump has made a number of statements along the lines of reducing US interventions and commitments abroad and trying to deal with Russia in a less confrontational manner, but he has sometimes contradicted himself by urging expanded arms, use of nuclear weapons, etc. But Hillary Clinton has said nothing that would offset her war-mongering. This difference from Trump may help explain the intensity of media hostility to Trump. 
AG: Jill Stein has said that ""wars for oil are blowing back at us wth a vengeance"" and that she would cut the military budget by half, close most of the foreign bases, and redirect resources into a Green New Deal that would fully employ Americans building sustainable energy and agricultural infrastructure. I can't imagine you disagree, but do you think it's important for the Greens to articulate such a vision at the national and international level, instead of focusing solely on local races that they might win? 
ESH: The Greens don't have the resources to compete in many local elections. So she is wise to focus on the big national and international issues. Furthermore, the real gap in the political system is the lack of opposition to national neoliberal and militaristic policies. It is said that she can't make a bigger mark given the hegemony of the duopoly, but even Ralph Nader couldn't get 5 percent of the vote. The system still works well, for the 1%. 
AG : Michael Moore has made a movie called ""Trumpland"" and warned that Trump's election would be the end of the United States , assuming that would be a bad thing. David Swanson, author of ""War Is a Lie,"" has imagined the same but argued, in "" Secession, Trump, and the Avoidability of Civil War ,"" that the break-up of the United States is not the worst possibility on the horizon. Do you have any thoughts on this? 
ESH: Michael Moore is completely oblivious to the fact that the enlarging war that is likely to follow Hillary Clinton's election threatens not only a nuclear exchange but also attacks on civil liberties and the march toward fascism. In its own way, the election of Hillary Clinton might threaten a democratic order as much as a Trump victory. The anti-Trump hysteria has tended to block out consideration of the Hillary Clinton menace. 
AG: Is there anything else you'd like to say about why you're voting for Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka? 
ESH: I've always believed in the moral rule laid down in the categorical imperative: ""Do that which you would wish generalized.""

ESH: Because the two duopoly candidates are dangerous to societal and international welfare and even survival. Hillary Clinton is a neo-liberal and pre-eminent war-monger. I think she is the most dangerous person living in the world today, given her highly likely election victory and her likely performance as president. She represents the corporate elite and military-industrial complex more clearly than Trump and she is a follow-on to Bush and Obama. She will pursue similar policies except for her somewhat more aggressive bent. 
Trump is a self-promoting windbag, racist and dangerous, unpredictable phony. We have a ghastly choice in these two. Jill Stein offers a protest opportunity, more so than not voting. On the line that either voting for Stein or not voting would constitute a vote for Trump, one might argue that a vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for war with Syria and Russia and a vote for Netanyahu (and hence for escalated violence in Palestine). 
AG: Hillary Clinton and John Podesta's e-mail has revealed that Hillary Clinton is well aware that the Saudi and Qatari rulers - not rogue elements - fund ISIS, and the same Saudi and Qatari rulers fund the Clinton Foundation. Throughout the last George Bush's presidency, there were innumerable headlines that ""Saudi oil sheikhs met with George Bush on his Crawford, Texas ranch."" What are your thoughts on that? 
ESH: Saudi Arabia is a US ally and an instrument of the warfare state. Hillary Clinton has treated its leaders warmly and she will continue to do so as president. The Clinton Foundation's receipt of money from Saudi and Qatari leaders is a first class conflict of interest and outrage, but the media have focused on the many less important abuses of Trump, helping cover over the outrages of their preferred candidate, Hillary Clinton, and her husband, Bill Clinton. 
AG: What do you think of Clinton's statement that she would make removing Bashar Al-Assad her top priority? And Trump's statement that he would not, because that would recklessly risk confrontation with Russia? 
ESH: Hillary Clinton has essentially promised to escalate war in Syria and is therefore promising to go to war with Russia as well. Diana Johnstone has made the case that Hillary Clinton plans to try to bring about ""regime change"" in Russia (cite). This is of course incredibly dangerous and would have aroused a really democratic media, but the existing media are part of the war system, hence Hillary Clinton's commitment to wars is essentially suppressed. Trump has made a number of statements along the lines of reducing US interventions and commitments abroad and trying to deal with Russia in a less confrontational manner, but he has sometimes contradicted himself by urging expanded arms, use of nuclear weapons, etc. But Hillary Clinton has said nothing that would offset her war-mongering. This difference from Trump may help explain the intensity of media hostility to Trump. 
AG: Jill Stein has said that ""wars for oil are blowing back at us wth a vengeance"" and that she would cut the military budget by half, close most of the foreign bases, and redirect resources into a Green New Deal that would fully employ Americans building sustainable energy and agricultural infrastructure. I can't imagine you disagree, but do you think it's important for the Greens to articulate such a vision at the national and international level, instead of focusing solely on local races that they might win? 
ESH: The Greens don't have the resources to compete in many local elections. So she is wise to focus on the big national and international issues. Furthermore, the real gap in the political system is the lack of opposition to national neoliberal and militaristic policies. It is said that she can't make a bigger mark given the hegemony of the duopoly, but even Ralph Nader couldn't get 5 percent of the vote. The system still works well, for the 1%. 
AG : Michael Moore has made a movie called ""Trumpland"" and warned that Trump's election would be the end of the United States , assuming that would be a bad thing. David Swanson, author of ""War Is a Lie,"" has imagined the same but argued, in "" Secession, Trump, and the Avoidability of Civil War ,"" that the break-up of the United States is not the worst possibility on the horizon. Do you have any thoughts on this? 
ESH: Michael Moore is completely oblivious to the fact that the enlarging war that is likely to follow Hillary Clinton's election threatens not only a nuclear exchange but also attacks on civil liberties and the march toward fascism. In its own way, the election of Hillary Clinton might threaten a democratic order as much as a Trump victory. The anti-Trump hysteria has tended to block out consideration of the Hillary Clinton menace. 
AG: Is there anything else you'd like to say about why you're voting for Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka? 
ESH: I've always believed in the moral rule laid down in the categorical imperative: ""Do that which you would wish generalized."" Ann Garrison an independent journalist based in Oakland, USA.","clinton dangerous person alive interview edward herman presidential campaign ann garrison

8163,Harvard Cancels Men’s Soccer Season After Finding Sexually Explicit ‘Reports’ Continued Through 2016,"Harvard Cancels Men’s Soccer Season After Finding Sexually Explicit ‘Reports’ Continued Through 2016 Andrew M. Duehren et al., Harvard Crimson, November 3, 2016 
Harvard has cancelled the men’s soccer team’s season after an Office of General Counsel review found that the team continued to produce vulgar and explicit documents rating women on their perceived sexual appeal and physical appearance. 
Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise wrote in an email to Harvard student athletes that he decided to cancel the rest of the team’s season because the “practice appears to be more widespread across the team and has continued beyond 2012, including in 2016.” 
“As a direct result of what Harvard Athletics has learned, we have decided to cancel the remainder of the 2016 men’s soccer season,” Scalise wrote. “The team will forfeit its remaining games and will decline any opportunity to achieve an Ivy League championship or to participate in the NCAA Tournament this year.” 
Last week, The Crimson reported that the 2012 men’s soccer team created a “scouting report” of that year’s women’s soccer recruits, rating them numerically and assigning each a hypothetical sexual position. University President Drew G. Faust instructed OGC, Harvard’s team of lawyers, to “review” the matter. 
{snip} 
“The decision to cancel a season is serious and consequential, and reflects Harvard’s view that both the team’s behavior and the failure to be forthcoming when initially questioned are completely unacceptable, have no place at Harvard, and run counter to the mutual respect that is a core value of our community,” Faust wrote in a statement. 
Faust wrote she “was deeply distressed to learn that the appalling actions of the 2012 men’s soccer team were not isolated to one year or the actions of a few individuals.” 
{snip} 
Last week, when Scalise first saw the documents—which were, until recently, publicly accessible through the 2012 team’s Google Group—he said he would immediately reach out to coaches of both men’s and women’s teams to discuss the report, but added that any response should be internal to Harvard and “not a media thing.” 
{snip} 
Men’s soccer coach Pieter S. Lehrer wrote in a statement that the team is “beyond disappointed that our season has ended in this way, but we respect the decision made by our administration.”

[10/31/16] A public school official in Florida has urged citizens to fight truancy by reporting any children they suspect might not be in school or being educated — including homeschool families. 
It is all part of an “anti-truancy” initiative called Operation Round Up, in which residents of Jackson County, Florida, are urged to be on the lookout for children not in school and to report them to school officials or to police. 
A truancy report can lead to a home check by sheriff’s deputies or police and possibly the arrest of the parents, TV station WJHG reported. 
The policy of the Jackson County School District is to send law enforcement to the homes of suspected truants. 
“Sometimes if these citizens don’t call me, I have no way of knowing,” Shirl Williams, director of student services for the school system, told the TV station. “So if it’s a nosy neighbor, be a nosy neighbor. Just call me and let me check out the situation.” Post navigation","HOMESCHOOL FAMILIES TARGETED IN DISTRICT’S ‘OPERATION ROUND UP’ Home › POLICE STATE › HOMESCHOOL FAMILIES TARGETED IN DISTRICT’S ‘OPERATION ROUND UP’ HOMESCHOOL FAMILIES TARGETED IN DISTRICT’S ‘OPERATION ROUND UP’ 0 SHARES

1396,Iowa's secretary of state rips Ted Cruz over campaign mailer,"""Today I was shown a piece of literature from the Cruz for President campaign that misrepresents the role of my office, and worse, misrepresents Iowa election law,"" Paul Pate, a Republican, said in a statement Saturday.

The mailer gave the recipient, along with their neighbors, poor grades based on their individual voting history. On one side, the mailer reads: ""ELECTION ALERT: VOTER VIOLATION,"" ""PUBLIC RECORD"" and ""FURTHER ACTION NEEDED.""

The other side of the mailer says ""VOTING VIOLATION"" in red letters at the top before text that reads:

""You are receiving this election notice because of low expected voter turnout in your area. Your individual voting history as well as your neighbors' are public record. Their scores are published below, and many of them will see your score as well. CAUCUS ON MONDAY TO IMPROVE YOUR SCORE and please encourage your neighbors to caucus as well. A follow-up notice may be issued following Monday's caucuses."" Cruz campaign spokeswoman Alice Stewart confirmed to CNN that the mailer was from the Cruz campaign. ""Accusing citizens of Iowa of a ""voting violation"" based on Iowa Caucus participation, or lack thereof, is false representation of an official act,"" Pate said in his statement. ""There is no such thing as an election violation related to frequency of voting. Any insinuation or statement to the contrary is wrong and I believe it is not in keeping in the spirit of the Iowa Caucuses."" Pate continued, ""Additionally, the Iowa Secretary of State's Office never 'grades' voters. Nor does the Secretary of State maintain records related to Iowa Caucus participation,"" Pate said. ""Also, the Iowa Secretary of State does not 'distribute' voter records. They are available for purchase for political purposes only, under Iowa Code."" Cruz, however, was defiant to reporters when asked about the mailer in Sioux City, Iowa, on Saturday night. ""I will apologize to no one for using every tool we can to encourage Iowa voters to come out and vote,"" he said. The mailer comes as Cruz is in a heated battle with GOP front-runner Donald Trump in the critical first-in-the-nation voting state. A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics survey released Saturday night found Trump holding a slight lead in the Hawkeye State, 28% to 23%. Put the CNN election center to work on your device.

2959,"Clinton commits Benghazi gaffe, saying US 'didn't lose a single person' in Libya","Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton committed her second gaffe in as many days on the campaign trail Monday night, claiming that the U.S. ""didn't lose a single person"" in Libya during her time as secretary of state.

Clinton made the comment defending her push for regime change in the war-torn North African nation at an Illinois town hall hosted by MSNBC.

""Now, is Libya perfect? It isn't,"" Clinton said. After contrasting her approach toward Libya with the ongoing bloodshed in Syria's civil war, Clinton said ""Libya was a different kind of calculation and we didn't lose a single person ... We didn’t have a problem in supporting our European and Arab allies in working with NATO.""

Clinton made no mention of the Sept. 11, 2012 terror attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya that killed four Americans: U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, information officer Sean Smith, and former Navy SEALS Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty.

Questions about the attack and its aftermath have dogged Clinton throughout her second run for the White House, with emails released by the State Department contradicting several aspects of her testimony before the House Select Committee investigating the attack.

Earlier Monday, Clinton's campaign was forced to scramble to clarify comments she made about coal jobs at a CNN town hall Sunday night.

""I'm the only candidate which has a policy about how to bring economic opportunity using clean renewable energy as the key into coal country,"" Clinton said, ""because we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.""

With many workers in crucial primary states like Ohio and Illinois relying on such jobs, Clinton's campaign put out a statement stressing that, “Coal will remain a part of the energy mix for years to come” and Clinton’s plan would also safeguard workers’ retirement and health benefits.

Spokesman Brian Fallon said “no candidate in this race is more devoted to supporting coal communities than Hillary Clinton” and “any suggestions otherwise are false.""","Clinton commits Benghazi gaffe, saying US 'didn't lose a single person' in Libya Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton committed her second gaffe in as many days on the campaign trail Monday night, claiming that the U.S. ""didn't lose a single person"" in Libya during her time as secretary of state.

361,House passes $612B defense policy bill despite veto threat,"The House passed a nearly $612 billion defense policy bill Friday despite President Obama's veto threat and Democratic worries that the measure opens the door to sharp cuts in domestic spending later this year.

The vote was 269 to 151 for the bill, which maps next year's military and national security programs.

A 2011 bipartisan budget deal placed caps on defense and domestic spending. The defense bill that passed skirts those limits by putting $89 billion of the total into an emergency war-fighting fund, which is exempt from the caps. Democrats predict that Republicans won't attempt to do end-runs around the spending caps when it comes to domestic spending.

Rep. Adam Smith of Washington state, the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, urged his colleagues to vote against the bill.

""It doesn't fix the problem,"" Smith said. ""The president has promised to veto all the appropriations bills and the defense bill that are based on this flawed approach to the budget. So what we are doing here is ultimately not going to be successful until we come up with a better long-term solution to dealing with the budget caps.""

Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, has acknowledged in recent days that the approach is not the best way to ""run a railroad.""

But he urged the Democrats Friday to vote for the bill anyhow by quoting the last line of an editorial published Friday in The Washington Post: ""Far better for him (Obama), and his party's leadership in Congress to help an adequate defense budget keep moving through Congress rather than perpetuate a fight all Americans, whether Republican or Democrat, might later regret.""

Overall, the House bill authorizes $515 billion in spending for national defense and another $89.2 billion for the emergency war-fighting fund for a total of $604.2 billion. Another $7.7 billion is mandatory defense spending that doesn't get authorized by Congress. That means the bill would provide the entire $611.9 billion desired by the president, but he and Democratic lawmakers still oppose it.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi wrote a letter on Thursday urging her colleagues to vote against the bill.

""The Republican defense authorization bill before the House is both bad budgeting and harmful to military planning -- perpetuating uncertainty and instability in the defense budget, and damaging the military's ability to plan and prepare for the future,"" the California Democrat wrote. ""As Defense Secretary (Ash) Carter said last week, Republicans' approach is `clearly a road to nowhere,' `managerially unsound' and `unfairly dispiriting to our force.' ""

The White House pushed back against a host of provisions in the bill, including one that would make it harder for Obama to close the military prison for terror suspects at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. On Ukraine, it calls for arming Ukrainian forces fighting Russian-backed separatists, a move the Obama administration has so far resisted.

The administration also opposes measures that aim to bypass the Iraqi government in Baghdad and give money directly to Iraqi Kurdish fighters. That has angered Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, who threatened to attack U.S. interests if the provision passes.

The Senate version follows the same approach to funding the military. The Senate Armed Services Committee voted 22-4 on Thursday to authorize $523 billion in base funding for the Defense Department and other national security programs and an additional $90.2 billion for the emergency war-fighting fund.

In the House, lawmakers debated 135 amendments to the measure.

The House voted 221-202 to strip an immigration provision opposed by conservatives. The nonbinding provision would have encouraged a Pentagon study on allowing immigrants brought illegally to the country as children to enlist in the military. Conservatives who pushed the vote say the measure would have encouraged amnesty and validated what they consider to be unconstitutional actions Obama has taken to protect millions of immigrants from deportation.","House passes $612B defense policy bill despite veto threat The House passed a nearly $612 billion defense policy bill Friday despite President Obama's veto threat and Democratic worries that the measure opens the door to sharp cuts in domestic spending later this year.

That means the bill would provide the entire $611.9 billion desired by the president, but he and Democratic lawmakers still oppose it.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi wrote a letter on Thursday urging her colleagues to vote against the bill.

""The Republican defense authorization bill before the House is both bad budgeting and harmful to military planning -- perpetuating uncertainty and instability in the defense budget, and damaging the military's ability to plan and prepare for the future,"" the California Democrat wrote. ""As Defense Secretary (Ash) Carter said last week, Republicans' approach is `clearly a road to nowhere,' `managerially unsound' and `unfairly dispiriting to our force.' ""

The White House pushed back against a host of provisions in the bill, including one that would make it harder for Obama to close the military prison for terror suspects at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. On Ukraine, it calls for arming Ukrainian forces fighting Russian-backed separatists, a move the Obama administration has so far resisted.

The administration also opposes measures that aim to bypass the Iraqi government in Baghdad and give money directly to Iraqi Kurdish fighters. That has angered Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, who threatened to attack U.S. interests if the provision passes.

The Senate version follows the same approach to funding the military. The Senate Armed Services Committee voted 22-4 on Thursday to authorize $523 billion in base funding for the Defense Department and other national security programs and an additional $90.2 billion for the emergency war-fighting fund.

In the House, lawmakers debated 135 amendments to the measure.

The House voted 221-202 to strip an immigration provision opposed by conservatives. The nonbinding provision would have encouraged a Pentagon study on allowing immigrants brought illegally to the country as children to enlist in the military. Conservatives who pushed the vote say the measure would have encouraged amnesty and validated what they consider to be unconstitutional actions Obama has taken to protect millions of immigrants from deportation.","house pass defense policy bill despite veto threat house pass nearly billion defense policy bill friday despite president obama's veto threat democratic worry measure open door sharp cut domestic spending later year.

1122,Top takeaways from the Miami Republican debate,"Before a critical round of primaries on Tuesday, the Republican presidential field gathered for a debate in Florida, site of perhaps next week's most pivotal contest.

Here are the top takeaways from Thursday night's debate:

You'd be forgiven if you assumed Thursday's debate would be something akin to a professional wrestling cagematch. After all, it was just a week ago that Trump was not-too-subtly defending his manhood in response to a recent jab from Marco Rubio about the size of his hands. There was none of that at the University of Miami. To be sure, there were shots at Trump, and he returned in kind, but they were mostly policy-oriented.

Rubio hit Trump on Social Security — ""the numbers don't add up,"" he said of Trump's proposals. Both Rubio and Ted Cruz took on the front-runner for being insufficiently supportive of Israel. ""On Israel, Donald has said he wants to be neutral between Israel and the Palestinians,"" Cruz said. ""As president, I will not be neutral."" That's a far cry from the tone and tenor of recent debates and perhaps a recognition by all the candidates — and particularly Trump, the favorite to emerge as the nominee — of a need to change the public's perception of the GOP campaign has voters look ahead to November.

Trump, perhaps the ultimate provocateur of the 2016 field, seemed almost stunned by what was happening on stage. ""So far, I cannot believe how civil it's been up here.""

It doesn't take sophisticated political analysis to understand that Rubio needs to win in his home state of Florida next Tuesday to maintain any semblance of a path forward, particularly after poor showings in this week's contests. The Florida senator has clearly moved away from the more personal assault on Trump, an approach he in recent days acknowledged he regretted.

On Thursday night, he aimed to take on Trump by more by demonstrating a superior understanding of policy, whether on entitlements or foreign policy. Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, also sought to draw a contrast with Trump on the restoration of relations between the United States and Cuba. Trump said he would've focused on making a better deal with the Communist nation. Rubio countered: ""Here's a good deal: Cuba has free elections, Cuba stops putting people in jail for speaking out, Cuba has freedom of the press . .... That's a good deal."" Earlier, pushing back against Trump's boasts against political correctness, the Florida senator scored some points with this line: ""I'm not interested in being politically correct. I'm interested in being correct.""

Polls paint a bleak picture for Rubio's hopes of overtaking Trump, but his more subdued, controlled approach to taking on the front-runner may at least give voters a glimpse of the candidate who, at least for a time, seemed to be the GOP establishment's best chance.

Cruz and Trump haven't found much to agree on recent weeks, but they did find common cause on one issue Thursday night: delegate math. ""I guess there's two of us up here that can, and there are two of us that cannot at this moment,"" Trump said, referring to himself and Cruz as the only two GOP hopefuls who can still win the nomination.

""Donald is right,"" Cruz said. ""There are only two of us that have a path to winning the nomination: Donald and myself."" Indeed, Trump and Cruz are far ahead in the delegate race, with the New York billionaire at 458 and Cruz with 359, according to the most recent Associated Press tally, more than 200 delegates ahead of Rubio's 151.

Cruz clearly wants a one-on-one battle with Trump, who, likewise, doesn't want delegates scattered so widely that it could increase the likelihood of a contested convention that ultimately turns against him. To that end, Trump laid down a marker for how he thinks the nomination should be decided, regardless of whether someone gets secures a majority 1,237 through the primaries, which he called ""a very random number.""

""I think that whoever gets the most delegates should win,"" Trump said. ""That's what I think.""

Ohio Gov. John Kasich, like Rubio, faces a must-win in his home state on Tuesday. In the University of Miami debate he sought, as he has throughout the campaign, to highlight his experience. He cited the support he had from ""55% of the foreign policy experts in this country"" and detailed his many years on the House Armed Services Committee.

He also defended some of his views that aren't exactly in sync with many of the party's most conservative activists. On Common Core, he said ""all I'm in favor of in Ohio is high standards."" Contrast that with Cruz, who called Common Core ""a disaster."" On the environment, Kasich said ""I do believe we contribute to climate change, but I don't think it has to be ... either you're for some environmental stringent rules or, you know, you're not going to have any jobs. The fact is, you can have both.""

These positions might be seen as heretical among some conservatives, but if — and it's a giant if — he can survive in the race long enough for states with larger segments of more moderate voters to hold contests, those views could position him as a more viable alternative to Trump or Cruz.","Top takeaways from the Miami Republican debate Before a critical round of primaries on Tuesday, the Republican presidential field gathered for a debate in Florida, site of perhaps next week's most pivotal contest.

10070,"The Fall of the Saudis, the Battle after ISIS","First published October 31, 2016 
Iraq is going to invade and destroy Saudi Arabia. They would have done it back in 1990 except for waffling by George H.W. Bush who had initially authorized the move and then rescinded approval, according to statements made by former Congressman Ron Paul, based on WikiLeaks State Department hacks. 
Saddam was blocked in 1990, and that may well have been a huge mistake on the part of everyone involved. When the US returned in 2003, it was Saudi cash that financed the Sunni Wahhabist was against the coalition government in Baghdad, a war that continues to this day, with the same cast of characters, the same Saudi cash, but they now call it “ISIS.” 
5000 Americans died fighting Saudi paid jihadists. 
Saudi Arabia has always known that Iraq has only allowed them to continue their mischief so long as they served a purpose. When the war with Iran ended in 1988, that purpose had ended also. 
Saudi mischief in Iraq, playing tribe against tribe, pushing for Kurdish separatism and partnering with Israeli intelligence, ramped up as America scaled back her military presence under President Obama. 
By 2014, a logistics and command structure to destroy both Syria and Iraq had been established, headquartered in the Saudi embassies in Beirut and Amman and operating military operations centers, designed and built by the Israelis, at key locations in Turkey and quickly bolstered by satellite facilities across Iraq and Syria. The Saudi’s were feeling time getting away from them, their decades of military buildup, based on endless oil and investment performance, no long sustainable. They had to knock out Syria and Iraq, using Israel, Turkey and NATO as surrogates, push the US into destroying Iran and cleanse Yemen of threats. 
They bribed everyone they got near. Were the Saudi’s really the ones behind the Arab spring? Do we see the hands of Saudi Arabia when Israel channels Hamas fighters into the Yarmouk Camp, outside Damascus, to bolster ISIS forces? These are the telling events few see, but that prove the hypothesis and provide what is needed to predict a future that may well no longer include the Dark Kingdom. 
With a world obsessed with Islamic extremism and terror threats, why is no one looking at where it comes from, who finances, whose ideas are behind it and who it serves? With fingers pointing at the Mossad or CIA and so many others, the real issue is Wahhabism and the real root of it all is Saudi Arabia. 
There is no version of 9/11 that doesn’t credit Saudi Mohammed Atta as planner of 9/11, whether assisted by Israeli art students or Osama bin Laden, depending on which theories you follow. The Saudi’s did it and American civil courts are busy now assessing the damages. 
Oil money and sovereign immunity and, oh yes, control of the UN Human Rights Council, from which Russia was just expelled, protect them also, despite their abuses and love of head chopping. Pro-Iran militias in Iraq 
What is playing out now will lead only one direction , to a stronger Iraq, one under Shiite control with the economically powerful Sunni families, quietly migrating to their second homes in Dubai and Qatar. 
The crippled military the US saddled Iraq with will be gone, replaced by powerful Iranian-trained militias. 
The American-trained army joined ISIS. Had Prime Minister Maliki, back in 2014, been more aware of the threat, he would have moved against the Army. That, however, would have renewed the civil war, a war that could only have been ended with Iranian military intervention and Iran was still reeling with sanctions and the threat of American invasion. 
That threat is gone also. That world is gone, or soon will be as is being played out in Mosul and Aleppo. No one would have imagined Baghdad’s resolve or the partnership between Russia and Iran. Still in question is Turkey’s role. It is clear someone promised them Aleppo and Mosul, as is reflected in their military incursions into Syria and Iraq. 
If Saudi Arabia thinks Turkey will lift a hand to block Iraq’s wrath, they are delusional. Turkey knows it can have peace with Iran and that both share similar ideas about the Kurds. This far outweighs any Turkish ambitions to the South. Turkey may well be planning a new Ottoman Empire, but Saudi Arabia is not in the cards for Turkish occupation. Members of the Abbas combat squad, a Shia militia, trained with Iraqi soldiers in Basra 
This leaves the protection of the United States and the upcoming election. Is there any American political leader that would oppose Iraq were they to hit Saudi Arabia, by 2020 or 2021? 
The prediction is that Iraq will come out of this war intact and, if they do, with a victorious army for the first time genuinely answerable to Baghdad and reeling from the battle of Mosul, likely to leave 20,000 civilians dead in its wake or more, the national enmity for Saudi Arabia will know no bounds. 
The Sunni gangsters from Anbar that aligned with the Saudis are mostly dead, many beheaded by ISIS. The promised Kurdish state in Erbil, the so-called “Barzani Sultanate” will not be handed control of the massive Kirkuk oil fields and the Ceyhan Pipeline by ISIS, as may well have been planned. 
Without these assets, Erbil will still enjoy a strong commercial presence but will never be able to reach into the Kurdish diaspora and bring the millions home and under questionable rule, subject to Erbil’s deal making with everyone. Eventually Erbil will become a ghost town, the sons that returned will again migrate and Turkish ambitions, seemingly undone, will be fulfilled. 
As it appears now, Iraq will survive. Iraq also knows that what Saudi Arabia tried twice, they will try again and that the only way Iraq can be free is if Saudi Arabia falls. 
And then there is Iran. Iranian aircraft have carried out strikes against the Islamic State.

1821,Romney's Exit Unleashes Race for Donors Among 2016 Hopefuls,"Mitt Romney's exit from the presidential campaign has unleashed a frenzy of fresh fundraising and set off a new race for the backing of donors who had remained loyal to the 2012 Republican nominee.

Big dollars were said to flow immediately on Friday to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who already had won over several of Romney's past donors. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie claimed the support of others who were waiting on Romney to make a decision about whether to seek the White House a third time.

Tony Carbonetti, a Christie supporter and top aide to former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a 2008 GOP candidate, said every major Republican donor got at least two calls on Friday — one from Christie's people and one from those promoting Bush.

None of the Republicans considering a run for president has formally entered the race. But most have established political committees that effectively serve as campaigns-in-waiting of varying sophistication. That step allows the politicians to raise money to pay for travel, staff and the logistics of getting ready to run for the White House.

The competition for donors to those organizations is fierce, with commitments signaling the potential strength of a nascent campaign and laying the groundwork for more fundraising to come.

Romney raised more than $57 million before the first voting in 2012, and that figure is often cited as this campaign's benchmark.

Even before Romney's announcement Friday, Bush had picked off several of Romney's past supporters. Among them was Lisa Wagner, a top Midwest fundraiser for Romney in 2012 who pushed hard to win over others Friday.

""I've raised a million dollars in the four hours since he announced that I otherwise would not have raised,"" she said. Her converts included Bill Kunkler, part of Chicago's wealthy Crown family, who had been holding out for Romney.

""I'll work for Jeb. Period. And no one else,"" he said.

Christie had his own pickups. None was more significant than Bobbie Kilberg, a Virginia-based fundraiser who said she and her husband were all-in for the former federal prosecutor.

""We will support him financially and we will be bundlers for him,"" she told The Associated Press, referring to the practice of rounding-up donations from friends, family and colleagues for a campaign.

Ray Washburne, the outgoing finance chairman of the Republican National Committee, has taken up the same position with Christie's political action committee. Washburne said his phone started ringing early Friday.

""It's been very, very positive. A lot of people that were kind of fence-sitters have come off the fence,"" he said. ""We've been very, very encouraged.""

Others were too upset or stunned by Romney's announcement to decide what to do next. That includes Bill Simmons, a Washington-based donor who raised money for both of Romney's previous campaigns.

""I haven't fully thought about the next step,"" he said.

He said Romney's announcement was like seeing his favorite team lose in the playoffs and then having to decide for whom to cheer in the Super Bowl. ""I guess I'll watch the game a little bit.""

Romney's flirtation with the race may have created space for a third candidate to compete alongside Bush and Christie for the support of establishment-minded donors and fundraisers.

With his exit, there is now room for someone else to step into that spot. In the hours after Romney's announcement, several GOP donors said Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker appeared to have the edge.

The news came at the end of a big week for Walker. He earned a standing ovation from a conservative crowd at a forum in Iowa last Saturday. The next day, he spoke to wealthy conservatives in California at an event organized by the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch.

Walker ended the week in Washington as the guest of wealthy Republican donor Fred Malek.

""Walker fits into that mainstream group, and this means he's getting a lot of interest and attention lately,"" said Republican consultant Charlie Black.

So, too, might Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who spent the week courting donors on the West Coast, Texas and Chicago after attending the Koch brothers' event.

Few donors interviewed after Romney's announcement mentioned the several candidates likely to compete to the right of Christie and Bush. That group includes Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee.

""Mitt was going to probably occupy a different place on the shelf than me,"" Huckabee said. ""I don't know that it has any impact on support, donors. It probably has a bigger impact on Jeb Bush and Chris Christie.""

South Carolina political strategist Warren Tomkins warned against singling out any one candidate, or type of candidate, as the clear beneficiary of Romney's decision.

""It still goes back to having a good message and a good messenger,"" said Tompkins, Romney's South Carolina campaign chairman in 2012.

10175,WH Press Secretary Says Obama's Denial About Clinton Server Was 'Entirely Factual'," 
After the release of a WikiLeaks email chain from March 2015 on Tuesday in which a top Clinton aide admitted President Barack Obama falsely claimed he did not know about Hillary Clinton’s private server use while she was secretary of state, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest sprung into action to deny that the president had lied about the issue.
“What the president said was an entirely factual response,” Earnest said to a group of reporters in Los Angeles where Obama was attending Democratic fundraisers.
Earnest then attempted to explain away all criticism of the president’s actions as mere conspiracies.
 
Related Stories Hannity Proposes A Sendoff For Obama In The Event Of A Trump Presidency WikiLeaks: Podesta Said Obamas ‘Don’t Need To Be This Nice’ To President Bush And First Lady WikiLeaks Reveals Obama Knew About Clinton’s Emails; ‘Clean This Up’ “I recognize that some of the president’s critics have attempted to construct some type of conspiracy about the communication between the president and the secretary of state,” he said.
He continued, “But they’ve failed to put forward a conspiracy that withstands any scrutiny, so I guess they are back to recycling thoroughly debunked conspiracies.”
Obama himself denied any knowledge of the server, telling CBS reporter Bill Plante in March 2015, just after the server revelations that he learned of the Clinton’s private email server “the same time everybody else learned it through news reports.”
 
Several days after the server revelations in March 2015, Earnest told the press that Obama knew about Clinton’s email address and had sent messages to it but knew nothing about a private server.
He reiterated that position on Tuesday.
“The president did trade emails with Secretary Clinton, not a large number of them,” Earnest said.
“Of course the president had possession of Secretary Clinton’s email address, but he did not have any knowledge of where her server was located or what sort of arrangements had been made to store her email.”
 
Trending Stories Frustrated With Media Bias, Trump Campaign Takes Its Case Directly To Voters With Nightly Show On Facebook Independent Voters Push Trump To The Front In Florida And Ohio RNC Official Takes CNN Host To Task For Claiming There Is No Media Bias However, the Wikileaks email chain – which Earnest referred to as “stolen” and therefore illegitimate – tells a different story, with top Clinton aides seemingly in a panic that it could come to light that the president was lying when he said he did not know about Clinton’s private server.
“[L]ooks like POTUS just said he found out HRC was using her personal email when he saw it in the news,” Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin said in a March 7, 2015 email published Tuesday by WikiLeaks.
“[W]e need to clean this up – he has emails from her – they do not say state.gov,” responded former Clinton chief of staff Cheryl Mills.
What do you think?","WH Press Secretary Says Obama's Denial About Clinton Server Was 'Entirely Factual'  
After the release of a WikiLeaks email chain from March 2015 on Tuesday in which a top Clinton aide admitted President Barack Obama falsely claimed he did not know about Hillary Clinton’s private server use while she was secretary of state, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest sprung into action to deny that the president had lied about the issue.
“What the president said was an entirely factual response,” Earnest said to a group of reporters in Los Angeles where Obama was attending Democratic fundraisers.
Earnest then attempted to explain away all criticism of the president’s actions as mere conspiracies.

He continued, “But they’ve failed to put forward a conspiracy that withstands any scrutiny, so I guess they are back to recycling thoroughly debunked conspiracies.”
Obama himself denied any knowledge of the server, telling CBS reporter Bill Plante in March 2015, just after the server revelations that he learned of the Clinton’s private email server “the same time everybody else learned it through news reports.”
 
Several days after the server revelations in March 2015, Earnest told the press that Obama knew about Clinton’s email address and had sent messages to it but knew nothing about a private server.
He reiterated that position on Tuesday.
“The president did trade emails with Secretary Clinton, not a large number of them,” Earnest said.
“Of course the president had possession of Secretary Clinton’s email address, but he did not have any knowledge of where her server was located or what sort of arrangements had been made to store her email.”

2423,The new surgeon general's 4 rules for health,"President Obama nominated him for the post of US surgeon general, the nation's top spokesperson for public health, back in November 2013. The Senate then promptly blocked his nomination for more than a year, particularly after the National Rifle Association criticized a letter Murthy had co-signed in support of gun control measures. Murthy only got confirmed in December 2014 after some red-state Democrats who were losing their seats anyway decided to switch course and back him.





In person, however, it's harder to see how the mild-tempered Murthy became such a lightning rod. He meditates daily, he told me, to ""center myself, a chance for me to remember who I want to be every day."" And he's starting his tenure with a listening tour that took him across America — rather than a push for any particular policies. Indeed, he has already said he wasn't interested in using his post ""as a bully pulpit for gun control.""

Before his swearing-in ceremony today, I spoke with Murthy at length about what he sees as the biggest public health issues facing the country, what he hopes to achieve as surgeon general, and why the best ways to boost health may have nothing to do with medicine.

The surgeon general is essentially the nation's top spokesperson on health matters. Past officeholders have often used the position to call attention to pressing public health issues such as smoking or obesity. Murthy plans to do the same. But though he's a physician by training, he argues that institutions outside of medicine often have the biggest impact on public health.

""I first started thinking about that when I was practicing medicine,"" Murthy says, ""and I realized that I would sit in the clinic with patients or sit at their bedside, and talk to them about changing their diet, about improving their physical activity. I would question how much of an impact I was having on their ultimate decisions about their lifestyle. If you ask any doctor or nurse who has cared for patients, they will often tell you they have had similar experiences.""

""It’s often our family and friends who can impact the choices we make around food""

He elaborated: ""If we think about ourselves, it’s often our family and friends who can impact the choices we make around food. It’s the food options that are available at work or in the cafeteria that might impact the choices we make during the third of our lives we spend at work. It can be what we hear in church Sunday morning that impacts how we think about important issues in our society.

""That’s why I have come to believe if we are going to overcome the great health challenges our country faces right now, we have to do so with a coalition of leaders. This includes not only doctors, nurses, and health professionals but also our employers, schools, faith-based organizations, civic institutions, and the various people and institutions in our country that actually impact decisions people make day to day.""

Take, for instance, the obesity crisis, which Murthy has called one of his top priorities. He argues that it's not enough to engage doctors on this issue — employers, faith-based organizations, and other institutions need to play a role, too.

""I want to make sure I’m working with employers to make physical activity a greater part of work culture — recognizing that this not only has benefits for the physical health of employees but also positive effects on emotional well-being and mental function,"" he says.

The same goes for mental health, which needs to be addressed by institutions outside of medicine. ""I want to work with faith-based leaders to address the negative attitudes associated with mental illness,"" he explains.

This, in general, fits with Murthy's broader approach to public health: ""We have to do more than build hospitals and more clinics. We have to invest in prevention and community prevention, and recognize that institutions that don’t have the word health in their name — faith-based groups, employers, schools — have a massive impact on the health decisions people make every day. That's why we have to engage these institutions in doing their part to improve health.""

So how does Murthy focus on staying healthy? ""I have four rules I follow for myself,"" he says.

""One is to eat healthy. I tend to avoid salt, added sugar, and processed foods whenever possible, and try to eat fresh fruits and vegetables as part of all my meals whenever possible.

""Second is to stay physically active. That means not just going to gym but incorporating activity into whatever I do, whether that’s taking the stairs or converting sitting meetings to walking meetings whenever possible.

""Third is making sure I’m focusing on my emotional and mental well-being. For me, an important part of that is the meditation practice that I do every morning. It’s a chance for me to center myself, a chance for me to remember who I want to be every day.

""The fourth thing is I remind myself to stay away from toxic substances like tobacco and drugs.""

The surgeon general doesn't just promote public health. From his perch, Murthy will also likely have to play a role in combating misinformation. I asked him about Dr. Oz, arguably the most famous health proselytizer in America, who has come under fire for his use of pseudoscience. ""I have never actually watched Dr. Oz on TV so I can’t really comment,"" Murthy says.

""Too often, doctors and nurses don’t speak out when it’s needed the most""

But Murthy does agree that the public often faces a problem in sorting through all the health information out there: ""In general, when people think about diet and physical activity, there’s a lot of information out there, and it can be very confusing for people. That's why I think it’s very important for us to understand the science behind the recommendations we make around diet and physical activity.""

He adds, ""I have been on the road a lot these last few months. One of the things that came up time and again was the pervasive misinformation that exists around certain hot-button issues. Diet is one of them. In recent months, in light of the measles outbreak, there has also been some confusion around vaccinations. That was an issue I spoke about a lot on the road, helping people understand that when it comes to the measles vaccine it's both safe and effective, and there's no link to autism.""

So what's Murthy's role in all this? ""I will continue to make sure we are getting scientifically grounded messages out there to the public about questions that concern them the most,"" he says. ""But it's not just the responsibility of the surgeon general but of every public health professional who understands science, who is trained to evaluate evidence, and who knows the cost we incur when patients are misinformed about the treatments they need.

""Too often, doctors and nurses don’t speak out when it’s needed the most — when there are controversies around issues, whether it be vaccines or e-cigarettes or other health topics. They can not only answer questions that the public may have but also push our institutions and policymakers and leaders to find answers when we don’t have them.""

Murthy's mention of e-cigarettes brought up a related question. E-cigarettes are one of the biggest puzzles facing the medical community right now, since the science behind them is still so nascent. So how does he think about the issue?

""Our scientific understanding of e-cigarettes has been far outpaced by the actual use of e-cigarettes""

""Our scientific understanding of e-cigarettes has been far outpaced by the actual use of e-cigarettes,"" Murthy says. ""This means people are asking questions we don’t always know the answers to. Some of those questions are: Do e-cigarettes have adverse effects on health? Do they lead children to be more open to smoking regular cigarettes? And do they help with cessation for people who are current smokers? These are questions we haven’t adequately answered yet through research — but we have to do so because, as a recent CDC report showed, e-cigarettes use tripled over the last year among youth. That to me is very concerning when we don’t fully understand the potential adverse impacts of e-cigarettes.""

He continues, ""Should we promote or allow the use of e-cigarettes by minors and by people who don’t smoke at all? This is where I'm concerned. We know nicotine is not a benign substance. We know it has potential harmful effects on the body including the development of the adolescent brain. Speaking as a regular person, I would not want my children — if I were blessed enough to have children — to be exposed to nicotine unnecessarily, whether that’s through their smoking of e-cigarettes or traditional cigarettes or whether that was through secondhand vapor or smoke.""

In April, Murthy did a public service announcement on Sesame Street to remind kids to get vaccinated. Can we expect more of that in the future?

""The public service announcement we did with Elmo around vaccines was just one example of the different types of communication tools we want to use to make sure we’re getting the right message to kids and adults about health,"" Murthy said. ""But to make sure we’re reaching everybody — to use a variety of messengers, messages, channels. We have to be creative about how we do it.

""When it comes to obesity, thinking about nutrition, I want to work closely with our entertainment leaders and our leaders in sports to make sure we’re setting positive role models for kids in particular when it comes to choices around physical activity and nutrition.

Speaking as a regular person, I would not want my children — if I were blessed enough to have children — to be exposed to nicotine unnecessarily, whether that’s through their smoking of e-cigarettes or traditional cigarettes or whether that was through secondhand vapor or smoke.""

In April, Murthy did a public service announcement on Sesame Street to remind kids to get vaccinated. Can we expect more of that in the future?

""The public service announcement we did with Elmo around vaccines was just one example of the different types of communication tools we want to use to make sure we’re getting the right message to kids and adults about health,"" Murthy said. ""But to make sure we’re reaching everybody — to use a variety of messengers, messages, channels. We have to be creative about how we do it.

""When it comes to obesity, thinking about nutrition, I want to work closely with our entertainment leaders and our leaders in sports to make sure we’re setting positive role models for kids in particular when it comes to choices around physical activity and nutrition.

5242,How Clinton's Email Controversy Is Affecting Her Campaign,"With just 59 days remaining until Election Day, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is still facing questions - and attacks - over her email controversy.

Her Republican opponent Donald Trump took shots at her over the issue Thursday while speaking in Cleveland.

""Remember, Hillary Clinton was emailing about the drone program among many other extremely sensitive matters. This is yet more evidence that Clinton is unfit to be your commander in chief,"" the business mogul charged.

Clinton has claimed that she didn't send or receive any email with classified marking, but a new report from Fox News says that a Clinton email had classified markings on virtually every paragraph.

Meanwhile, Clinton talked freely about her faith to the National Baptist Convention, the oldest African-American Baptist denomination.

""Sometimes people ask me, are you a praying person? And I tell them, 'If I wasn't one before, one week living in the White House or on the campaign trail would've turned me into a praying person,"" she said in Kansas City, Missouri, Thursday,

Clinton's lead over Trump has been dropping in the polls in recent days. But the race will, as always, come down to the Electoral College, especially in the swing states -- and the polls show the race getting tighter in four of the key states.

In a new Quinnipiac poll that also includes the two independent candidates, Trump has a slight lead in Ohio, but is tied with Clinton in Florida. The former secretary of state, however, holds slim leads in Pennsylvania and North Carolina.

While Clinton still appears to be ahead in the Electoral College, the campaign is far from over.

Both candidates are likely to focus the last two months of the campaign on the battleground states, where the race will almost certainly be decided.","How Clinton's Email Controversy Is Affecting Her Campaign With just 59 days remaining until Election Day, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is still facing questions - and attacks - over her email controversy.

3738,Police say 170 arrested in deadly biker gang shootout at Texas restaurant,"Police in Waco, Tex., said Monday they had arrested 170 people after a shootout involving multiple biker gangs at a restaurant that left at least nine people dead.

While investigators worked to piece together precisely what happened on Sunday, authorities said they remained alert after receiving threats of possible retaliation against police officers after the chaotic brawl.

The sea of people arrested were charged with engaging in organized criminal activity, which is a capital murder charge due to the number of victims, Sgt. W. Patrick Swanton, a Waco police spokesman, said at a news conference Monday.

“There was a significant danger here yesterday because of the amount of violence that occurred behind us here,” Swanton said while standing in front of the restaurant.

The spasm of deadly violence began when members of biker gangs began fighting inside the restroom of Twin Peaks, a restaurant in a retail strip on Interstate 35 known to locals as a biker bar. In addition to firearms, the fighting involved fists, feet, knives and chains, officials said.

Swanton said that gunfire began inside the restaurant before spilled out onto the patio bar area and then into the parking lot. Several shooting victims were found near the front of the restaurant or in the parking lot around it, he said.

“We had wounded inside, we had people stabbed, we had people shot and we had people beat,” Swanton said.

There were already 18 police officers and another four officers from the state Department of Public Safety in the parking lot because officials had received information about the danger posed by these gangs being in the same place, Swanton said. Once outside, the bikers turned their gunfire on the police officers who responded, he said.

“Those officers’ reactions…to a very hostile, deadly situation saved our citizens’ lives yesterday afternoon,” Swanton said.

After the fighting, authorities said that nine people had been killed, and remarkably no police officers or other bystanders in the area had been injured.

The 170 people taken into custody were initially taken to the city’s convention center for processing before being brought to the McLennan County Jail, which was still working to process all of these individuals on Monday.

Police originally said 192 people were arrested, but Swanton revised that number on Monday and said it was possible the number could still change as they continued to sift through all of the names.

The jail, located about 15 minutes away from the retail strip where the shootings occurred, was still working Monday morning to process all of the people who had been arrested, an official said.

Authorities continued to investigate the area around the Twin Peaks restaurant on Monday. More than 100 motorcycles and dozens of other vehicles remained in the parking lot.

“We’re not in a rush,” Swanton said. “This is obviously a very large investigation involving numerous agencies and organizations, and we’re going to get it right.”

[Police: Restaurant has some answering to do]

Swanton said police have received information about “payback” against officers and reports of bikers flooding into the area after the shooting. As a result, he said officers have been stationed around the region to watch for any threat.

“There was a green light put out on law enforcement is our understanding from last night,” he said Monday. “We’re aware of that threat, and we have the appropriate response if we have to face that.”

The brawl occurred on Sunday at noon at the sports bar, with violence erupting and sending terrified patrons diving for cover in a busy Central Texas shopping center.

Swanton was critical of the restaurant, saying after the shootout that its management has “not been of much assistance to us.”

It was typical to see motorcycles parked outside of Twin Peaks, said Saul Cornejo Bravo, 19, a server at a Mexican restaurant next door.

“But not that many, especially on a Sunday afternoon,” he said. “Usually I see them there later at night.”

Bravo said that he was working on Sunday when the shooting occurred, and within seconds he saw emergency vehicles flooding the parking lot.

He saw one man wearing a biker’s vest who appeared to have been shot in the stomach. Paramedics tried to perform CPR for several minutes, Bravo said. “Then they just covered him up,” he said.

Off-duty police officers shopping in the retail strip rushed to the scene despite lacking any protective gear, Swanton said. Meanwhile, some of the people who ran away from Twin Peaks as the chaos unfolded took shelter behind an empty building.

“We sat there gathering our wits,” said J.R., who works at Cabela’s Outpost, an outdoors store across the parking lot from Twin Peaks. “At first you think it’s like a carjacking or something. But then, with all the shots and people running you realize it’s something more serious.”

Police said in a statement Monday said the Twin Peaks restaurant and parking lot were “still a very active crime scene” — one that “is littered with bullets, blood and other evidence. Civilian as well as Police units with bullet holes remain to be processed.” Parts of Central Texas Market Place, where the Twin Peaks sports bar is located, were expected to remain closed for the day, police said.

Five known gangs were believed to be involved in the brawl, Swanton said, but he would not identify them on Monday.

“I am not about to give them the respect of mentioning their names…. We don’t care what their names are, and we’re not going to give them publicity,” he said.

Swanton said it was still not clear how many shots were fired by gang members or police. It was unclear whether any of the nine bikers killed in the fight were shot by police.

“It was chaos,” said J.R., who declined to give his last name. “People were screaming and going crazy. Most of it seemed to be in the parking lot, and it was over very quickly.”

All of the people charged with organized crime activity will face a capital murder charge, Swanton said, due to the number of people killed Sunday. Texas state law says that a person who murders more than one other person “during the same criminal transaction” can face this charge, while  suspects can be charged with organized criminal activity if they carry out a murder or capital murder as part of a criminal street gang.

Eighteen people were taken to hospitals after the brawl with injuries that included stab and gunshot wounds, Swanton said. Some victims were being treated for both, he told reporters in Central Texas on Sunday.

“I was amazed that we didn’t have innocent civilians killed or injured,” Swanton said, according to the Associated Press, which noted:

McLennan County Sheriff Parnell McNamara said all nine who were killed were members of the Bandidos or Cossacks gangs, according to the AP.

A threat assessment released last year by the Texas Department of Public Safety classified the Bandidos gang in the second-highest tier threat. The Department of Justice lists the Bandidos as one of the handful of organized motorcycle gangs that “pose a serious national domestic threat.”

[How the Bandidos became one of the world’s most feared biker gangs]

For some in the region, they could sense rising friction between the different motorcycle gangs when members were at the same bars and restaurants.

“There were these little tiffs going on, and then you add alcohol,” said Richard, a motorcycle enthusiast who also declined to give his last name. “I just felt like there was tension.”

He said biker had activity had increased in and around Waco in the last few years, probably because of its proximity to both the Dallas-Fort Worth area and Austin.

“Ninety nine percent of of the people who ride bikes are good people, doctors, lawyer, engineers,” said Richard, an engineer. “It’s the one percent that don’t care about anything. They say, ‘We’ll do what we do.’ It was a rude awakening for the rest of us. Is this going to land on our doorsteps? Is this what we have to look forward to? What happens if we’re wearing the wrong shirt in the wrong neighborhood? That’s what has a lot of us worried.”

On Sunday, witnesses described seeing a mass shootout that involved dozens of of guns being fired inside the restaurant and in the parking lot along Interstate 35, according to CBS affiliate KWTX. The station reported that panicked patrons and employees sought refuge from the mayhem in the restaurant freezer.

Hours later, authorities from multiple law enforcement agencies — including local and state police, and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives — were still trying to secure the area and survey the large crime scene, which was littered with more than 100 weapons.

“In 34 years of law enforcement, this is the most violent crime scene I have ever been involved in,” Swanton said, according to the Waco Tribune-Herald. “There is blood everywhere. We will probably approach the number of 100 weapons.”

Swanton called it “one of the worst gun fights we’ve ever had in the city limits. They started shooting at our officers.”

The officers returned fire, Swanton said, and some armed bikers were shot by police. Swanton defended the officers’ actions and said they prevented more deaths.

“Their action has saved lives in keeping this from spilling into a very busy Sunday morning,” he said, according to CNN. “Thank goodness the officers were here, and took the action that they needed to take to save numerous lives.”

Authorities said it was not immediately clear what precisely triggered the violence, but the potential for conflict did not surprise the Twin Peaks staff or officers. McLennan County District Attorney Abel Reyna told the AP that tensions between the gangs had been building for months.

Police were bracing for violence: Swanton said Waco police officers and state officers were at the sports bar when the fighting began and that they had secured the area because they “expected issues.” He said the restaurant’s management requested the officers in anticipation of trouble.

“We have been made aware in the last few months of rival biker gangs — rival criminal biker gangs — being here and causing issues,” Swanton said. “We have attempted to work with the local management of Twin Peaks to get that cut back, to no avail. They have not been of much assistance to us.”

Jay Patel, operating partner for the Twin Peaks franchise in Waco, said in a statement Sunday: “We are horrified by the criminal, violent acts that occurred outside of our Waco restaurant today. We share in the community’s trauma. Our priority is to provide a safe and enjoyable environment for our customers and employees, and we consider the police our partners in doing so.”

Patel added that “our management team has had ongoing and positive communications with the police and … we will continue to cooperate with the police as they investigate this terrible crime.”

Swanton called Patel’s statement a “fabrication,” according to the AP, which reported that the Waco police “described the management as uncooperative with authorities in addressing concerns about the gangs.”

“Are we frustrated? Sure,” Swanton said, according to CNN. “Because we feel like there may have been more that could have been done by a business to prevent this.”

Police said Monday that the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission “is implementing a Summary Suspension closing Twin Peaks for at least 7 days. This is not a punitive action on TABC’s part but done due to the ongoing danger it presents to our community.”

CBS affiliate KWTX reported that the Twin Peaks corporate office canceled the Waco store’s franchise agreement on Monday.

“We are in the people business and the safety of the employees and guests in our restaurants is priority one,” the company said in a statement, according to KWTX. “Unfortunately the management team of the franchised restaurant in Waco chose to ignore the warnings and advice from both the police and our company, and did not uphold the high security standards we have in place to ensure everyone is safe at our restaurants.

“We will not tolerate the actions of this relatively new franchisee and are revoking their franchise agreement immediately. Our sympathies continue to be with the families of those who died and are very thankful no employees, guests, police officers or bystanders were hurt or injured.”

A witness who had just finished lunch at a nearby restaurant told KWTX that he and his family walked into the parking lot when they heard multiple gunshots and saw wounded people being removed from the scene.

“We crouched down in front of our pickup truck because that was the only cover we had,” said the man, who asked not to be identified.

Another witness, Michelle Logan, told the Tribune-Herald: “There were maybe 30 guns being fired in the parking lot, maybe 100 rounds. They just opened fire. … There’s a lot of people in the hospital, a lot of people shot.”

Vehicles parked near the restaurant were riddled with bullet holes, the newspaper noted.

Headquartered in Dallas, Twin Peaks is a casual dining chain with dozens of locations nationwide that employs a largely female staff scantily clad in plaid shirts and mini shorts.

“Twin Peaks Girls,” the company advertises, offer customers “signature ‘Girl Next Door’ charisma and playful personalities.”

The Waco location opened in August and was touted by a company spokesman as offering 24 types of beer and 55 flatscreen TVs, as well as “Bike Night” on Thursdays.

“Get revved up and ready to go at Twin Peaks bike night,” a calendar on the Twin Peaks Waco Web site advertised.

We share in the community’s trauma. Our priority is to provide a safe and enjoyable environment for our customers and employees, and we consider the police our partners in doing so.”

Patel added that “our management team has had ongoing and positive communications with the police and … we will continue to cooperate with the police as they investigate this terrible crime.”

Swanton called Patel’s statement a “fabrication,” according to the AP, which reported that the Waco police “described the management as uncooperative with authorities in addressing concerns about the gangs.”

“Are we frustrated? Sure,” Swanton said, according to CNN. “Because we feel like there may have been more that could have been done by a business to prevent this.”

Police said Monday that the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission “is implementing a Summary Suspension closing Twin Peaks for at least 7 days. This is not a punitive action on TABC’s part but done due to the ongoing danger it presents to our community.”

CBS affiliate KWTX reported that the Twin Peaks corporate office canceled the Waco store’s franchise agreement on Monday.

“We are in the people business and the safety of the employees and guests in our restaurants is priority one,” the company said in a statement, according to KWTX. “Unfortunately the management team of the franchised restaurant in Waco chose to ignore the warnings and advice from both the police and our company, and did not uphold the high security standards we have in place to ensure everyone is safe at our restaurants.

“We will not tolerate the actions of this relatively new franchisee and are revoking their franchise agreement immediately. Our sympathies continue to be with the families of those who died and are very thankful no employees, guests, police officers or bystanders were hurt or injured.”

A witness who had just finished lunch at a nearby restaurant told KWTX that he and his family walked into the parking lot when they heard multiple gunshots and saw wounded people being removed from the scene.

“We crouched down in front of our pickup truck because that was the only cover we had,” said the man, who asked not to be identified.

Another witness, Michelle Logan, told the Tribune-Herald: “There were maybe 30 guns being fired in the parking lot, maybe 100 rounds. They just opened fire. … There’s a lot of people in the hospital, a lot of people shot.”

Vehicles parked near the restaurant were riddled with bullet holes, the newspaper noted.

Headquartered in Dallas, Twin Peaks is a casual dining chain with dozens of locations nationwide that employs a largely female staff scantily clad in plaid shirts and mini shorts.

“Twin Peaks Girls,” the company advertises, offer customers “signature ‘Girl Next Door’ charisma and playful personalities.”

The Waco location opened in August and was touted by a company spokesman as offering 24 types of beer and 55 flatscreen TVs, as well as “Bike Night” on Thursdays.

“Get revved up and ready to go at Twin Peaks bike night,” a calendar on the Twin Peaks Waco Web site advertised.

Holley, du Lac and Berman reported from Washington. Madigan reported from Waco.

2745,"You really expect me to believe that? Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and our liberal media","Reporter: Mr. President, when did you first learn that Hillary Clinton used an email system outside the U.S. government for official business when she was Secretary of State?

POTUS: The same time as everybody else, through news reports.

On Sunday, President Obama insisted he knew nothing about Hillary Clinton and her use of a separate server to send email while serving as his secretary of state for four years, and learned about it through news reports along with the rest of us. How many times have we seen this movie? How many times has this administration been confronted with a scandal only to have the president or his spokesmen make this statement with straight faces?

It makes you wonder: What goes on behind the scenes that results in these whoppers? Since this administration lives in a fantasy land, let's imagine scenes of our own:

RG: Mr. President, we're so very sorry to interrupt your game --

POTUS, staring at VPOTUS, irritated: Why are you here?

RG: Sir, it looks like that Air Force One photo-op over Manhattan almost caused a massive panic. We need a response from you.

POTUS: Joe, can't you handle this?

VPOTUS: It's your plane, sir. Mine was flying over Pittsburgh and no one noticed.

RG: We have your talking points, sir. Just tell the press, ""It was a mistake. It was something we found out about along with all of you.""

POTUS: Fine. Now get lost, both of you.

That scenario may be fictional -- but those were, in fact, the very words Obama used.

March 22, 2011, 11:15 AM. Oval Office. WH Press Secretary Jay Carney and Biden enter. Obama is yawning.

JC: Sir, we have a situation. The Republicans have learned about Fast and Furious killing that agent. CNN wants to know how much you knew.

POTUS: Big deal. I'll tell 'em -- how's this -- ""I heard on the news about this Fast and Furious story where allegedly"" -- (laughs) get that? -- ""guns were being run into Mexico."" What the hell. I'll also say ""the Attorney General has been very clear he knew nothing about this.""  Holder will owe me one. Where's Biden with my coffee?

Those were the very phrases Obama uttered that day.

JC: The cat's out of the bag, Mr. President. They know about the IRS going after those

Tea Party nuts. You have to say something during your presser with Cameron today.

Later that day, at White House press conference with British PM David Cameron.

POTUS: Well let me take the IRS situation first. I first learned about it from the same news reports that I think most people learned about this. I think it was on Friday.

JC: Another problem, sir. DOJ subpoenaed the AP to get those phone records. The press ain't happy about this.

POTUS: Can't you see I'm busy? You take care of it. (Looking irritated at Biden) Shouldn't you be at a funeral?

JZ: Come on, man, shoot! Ain't got all day.

Later that day at the White House Press Briefing:

Reporter: When did the president find out about the Department of Justice subpoenas for the Associated Press?

JC:  Yesterday. We found out about the news reports yesterday on the road.

VPOTUS: Jay, we've got a situation. They know about those fraudulent VA reports. This one's big! What should we do?

JC: (sigh) I'll take care of it. Get me a Starbucks.

Reporter: The delays have been known for some time, but the fraudulent --

JC: If you mean the specific allegations that I think we're reported first by your network, I believe we learned about them through the reports.

It is simply inconceivable -- no, unbelievable -- that the press knows more about the scandals surrounding this administration than does the administration.

It begs the question: So why do the media put up with this nonsense? They know that they're being played for fools and yet they go along with it, time and again. Their loyalty to Barack Obama is that strong.

Why does this administration constantly lie? Because they can.

,,,,,,,,,,, every single person I ran into there seemed… happy. And you could feel it too. I have also been to lima peru, bahli indonesia, melbourne austrailia, hobart tasmania, and some places in the middle east. Anyways, each time, same deal(with the exception of the middle east) you could feel the attitude there, festive and fun. The feeling I get in the states is disconnected and cold. People don’t want to socialize with each other here. Maybe it’s because of technology overload. People don’t get out of their cars and walk anymore. There’s no street vendors or anything either… It feels dead here. >_> Mudpie ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes life america definitely go extremely challenge year ahead grass always green side planet either

the follow question ask decide move another country… 
do speak language function 
if speak language country move create huge problem go store buying food become challenge every interaction anyone society strain ability integrate culture around greatly limited 
how make live 
unless independently wealthy need make money foreign nation may difficult find job especially one pay much accustomed make united state 
will okay without family friend 
being thousand mile away family friends extremely difficult okay without difficult survive foreign culture without kind support system sometimes people successfully move country part large group 
have factor weather pattern geological instability 
as globe become increasingly unstable weather pattern natural disaster go become big factor decide live example right india suffer bad drought experience nearly year would difficult thrive middle environment 
many encouraging people “escape america” point chile ideal place relocate thousand significant earthquake chile year entire nation lie directly along “ring fire” become increasingly unstable something keep mind 
what medical care 
if someone family serious medical problem united state would know yes health care system incredibly mess least would know could get care needed emergency arise would true foreign nation 
are move high crime area 
yes crime definitely rise united state area many preppers move crime even bad mexico certain area central america two example many foreign nation police far corrupt generally united state 
in addition many nation far strict gun law united state ability defend family may greatly restrict 
so family truly safe nation plan take 
are prepared “culture shock” 
moving another country like move different planet don’t call “culture shock” nothing 
if move another country may quickly find thousand little thing take grant u.s different 
and good chance many “amenities” accustom u.s available foreign nation standard live go 
so think move somewhere else may want visit first get idea life would like make move 
what freedoms liberty lose move 
yes liberty freedoms rapidly erode united state many nation around world thing much bad may find thing “freedom speech” “freedom religion” country decide move 
is possibility country plan escape could involve war point 
we move time great geopolitical instability move right middle future war zone might really regret plan move try find country likely avoid war foreseeable future 
when global economy collapse family okay food 
what good leave unite state family run food 
today verge major global food crisis global food reserve lowest level nearly year shift global weather pattern certainly help thing 
and global elite rapidly get control global food supply today percent international trade grain control four gigantic multinational food corporation 

leaving united state permanently set new life another country do isn’t faint heart take plan preparation lot hard work 
however lots people do successfully include quite number people know personally 
in end get make decision right family don’t let anyone else tell 
for many stay united state prepare tough year come best choice others get head greener pasture right choice

great point go fairly usa-friendly country live work fairly long period time though liked definitely bias american particular base fact get lots stuff tv ignorant well also honestly really anymore nice guy use reason dislike u often memadmax 
the gastonguays steal idea anyways find idea leave state necessary truth families’ survival excite endeavor dunno maybe it’s exposed country look u go well… suck may “rich powerful” suck time one time walk street santiago saw country rich culture money yet every single person run seemed… happy could feel also lima peru bahli indonesia melbourne austrailia hobart tasmania place middle east anyways time deal(with exception middle east could feel attitude festive fun feel get state disconnect cold people don’t want socialize maybe it’s technology overload people don’t get car walk anymore there’s street vendor anything either… feel dead mudpie 
living abroad eye opener love place truly america suck seem fill artificial people thing point history see another perspective cement culture vile moral sewer see attack george zimmerman almost could bear turn seethe cesspool 
but grass always greener even though america bad shape truly emigrate another place pretty radical necessarily solution make community similar thinking friend enjoy natural beauty u even people beautiful place appreciate natural beauty west e.g may best way go 
but salute may still join point 
one thing sure need become less emotionally connect construct “america” even year ago day go good need clear eye move ahead principle 
for instance hear star spangle banner scoff day longer land free home brave 
what true lie xander cross 
attack zimmerman murder kid molest cousin white people sick evil mudpie 
yeah white people sick evil sequoia 
you probably mixed white european blood ansestry too.about everyone mixed day good evil every race nationality isn,t fair point finger one race people zimmerman,he hispanic white jewish black grandfather peru.he mixed need come together one people evil government hijack foreign shore bank come together american seanyboyo 
zimmerman white european heritage father ashkenazy jew european mother native peruvian indian black father i’m white european ancestry trace back year side may family n&s ireland immigrate england century genetic grouping like western european make white way racist zander utilise ethnicity place people connection white european amongst u facilitate ideological racist hate white people’s classic definition racist ideology zander ilk need fight ethnicity become minority hold zander co we’ll find leftist pc defender belligerent intolerance that’ll surpass bad nightmare people deserve ethnic cultural protection white include ray cimbalnik 
i agree hit nail head people country mention might less money but…they much happier friendly people experienced country side note also generally healthy people america process try tie loose end expatriate soon 
what country feel best infocyde 
also notice lot expat friend still income source somehow tie u support tourism new country online business remote worker proud leave see giant gap hole strategy temporary solution ok check come usa usa/western tourism crash might vulnerable mudpie 
it true hard business overseas unless one rich many hurdle bank custom rule though lived bank much well real people answer phone politely god hate become time zone issue hard get thing do state overseas sequoia 
if someone move another country dependent social security check income usa,will screw s#!t hit fan usa go bankrupt completely relocate another country,keep mind mabey need another source income move another country,now time try open business find work,because one day check go come poor like usa need stragety plan leave infocyde 
i say though much love america think hard get trajectory towards fascism won’t get easy leave plan imho doesn’t mean successful leave option get hard time progress another factor add calculus frankensteingovernment 
at point begin realize government simply go tax death strategy cope massive debt incur 
so folk see obvious it’s go get lot bad get good it’s clear u countryman bunch apathetic coward 
expatriating look good also memadmax 
there post zerohedge guy describe united state “prissy cheerleader think world revolve around her” didn’t show school place would close friend would commit suicide teacher would quit… well quite get gist right fact matter world really care us… neither like dislike want get life like rest us… “third world countries” really bad… get mostly tv’s car toilets… etc… mudpie 
again pretty much agree cannot deny strong tradition liberty many people still carry say 
i notice thing america though max many overseas economy boom free even think china felt economically vibrant though would afraid post year nsa start disappear people kind thing davidmpark 
there’s old wisdom “a coward hero wife kid mortgage.” guess that’s what’s go 
wish could leave always want go back ancestral home edinburgh glasgow bristol brighton small village parc france family legend get name charlemagne family choice stay put 
i’d rather fight know collapse international civil war come study possible effect outcomes come conclusion america go well long term rest world 
my reason obama next president become fascist dictator fail united state collapse dictator elect come perfect storm get u also 
many leave reason well elsewhere true they’ll get war come anyway cast benedict arnold coriolanus role 
i think leave sick crazy conservative like paul ryan take poor give rich davidmpark
