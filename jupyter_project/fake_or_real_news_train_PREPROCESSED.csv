8476,You Can Smell Hillary’s Fear,Daniel Greenfield | a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center | is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam. In the final stretch of the election | Hillary Rodham Clinton has gone to war with the FBI. The word “unprecedented” has been thrown around so often this election that it ought to be retired. But it’s still unprecedented for the nominee of a major political party to go war with the FBI. But that’s exactly what Hillary and her people have done. Coma patients just waking up now and watching an hour of CNN from their hospital beds would assume that FBI Director James Comey is Hillary’s opponent in this election. The FBI is under attack by everyone from Obama to CNN. Hillary’s people have circulated a letter attacking Comey. There are currently more media hit pieces lambasting him than targeting Trump. It wouldn’t be too surprising if the Clintons or their allies were to start running attack ads against the FBI. The FBI’s leadership is being warned that the entire left-wing establishment will form a lynch mob if they continue going after Hillary. And the FBI’s credibility is being attacked by the media and the Democrats to preemptively head off the results of the investigation of the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton. The covert struggle between FBI agents and Obama’s DOJ people has gone explosively public. The New York Times has compared Comey to J. Edgar Hoover. Its bizarre headline | “James Comey Role Recalls Hoover’s FBI | Fairly or Not” practically admits up front that it’s spouting nonsense. The Boston Globe has published a column calling for Comey’s resignation. Not to be outdone | Time has an editorial claiming that the scandal is really an attack on all women. James Carville appeared on MSNBC to remind everyone that he was still alive and insane. He accused Comey of coordinating with House Republicans and the KGB. And you thought the “vast right wing conspiracy” was a stretch. Countless media stories charge Comey with violating procedure. Do you know what’s a procedural violation? Emailing classified information stored on your bathroom server. Senator Harry Reid has sent Comey a letter accusing him of violating the Hatch Act. The Hatch Act is a nice idea that has as much relevance in the age of Obama as the Tenth Amendment. But the cable news spectrum quickly filled with media hacks glancing at the Wikipedia article on the Hatch Act under the table while accusing the FBI director of one of the most awkward conspiracies against Hillary ever. If James Comey is really out to hurt Hillary | he picked one hell of a strange way to do it. Not too long ago Democrats were breathing a sigh of relief when he gave Hillary Clinton a pass in a prominent public statement. If he really were out to elect Trump by keeping the email scandal going | why did he trash the investigation? Was he on the payroll of House Republicans and the KGB back then and playing it coy or was it a sudden development where Vladimir Putin and Paul Ryan talked him into taking a look at Anthony Weiner’s computer? Either Comey is the most cunning FBI director that ever lived or he’s just awkwardly trying to navigate a political mess that has trapped him between a DOJ leadership whose political futures are tied to Hillary’s victory and his own bureau whose apolitical agents just want to be allowed to do their jobs. The only truly mysterious thing is why Hillary and her associates decided to go to war with a respected Federal agency. Most Americans like the FBI while Hillary Clinton enjoys a 60% unfavorable rating. And it’s an interesting question. Hillary’s old strategy was to lie and deny that the FBI even had a criminal investigation underway. Instead her associates insisted that it was a security review. The FBI corrected her and she shrugged it off. But the old breezy denial approach has given way to a savage assault on the FBI. Pretending that nothing was wrong was a bad strategy | but it was a better one that picking a fight with the FBI while lunatic Clinton associates try to claim that the FBI is really the KGB. There are two possible explanations. Hillary Clinton might be arrogant enough to lash out at the FBI now that she believes that victory is near. The same kind of hubris that led her to plan her victory fireworks display could lead her to declare a war on the FBI for irritating her during the final miles of her campaign. But the other explanation is that her people panicked. Going to war with the FBI is not the behavior of a smart and focused presidential campaign. It’s an act of desperation. When a presidential candidate decides that her only option is to try and destroy the credibility of the FBI | that’s not hubris | it’s fear of what the FBI might be about to reveal about her. During the original FBI investigation | Hillary Clinton was confident that she could ride it out. And she had good reason for believing that. But that Hillary Clinton is gone. In her place is a paranoid wreck. Within a short space of time the “positive” Clinton campaign promising to unite the country has been replaced by a desperate and flailing operation that has focused all its energy on fighting the FBI. There’s only one reason for such bizarre behavior. The Clinton campaign has decided that an FBI investigation of the latest batch of emails poses a threat to its survival. And so it’s gone all in on fighting the FBI. It’s an unprecedented step born of fear. It’s hard to know whether that fear is justified. But the existence of that fear already tells us a whole lot. Clinton loyalists rigged the old investigation. They knew the outcome ahead of time as well as they knew the debate questions. Now suddenly they are no longer in control. And they are afraid. You can smell the fear. The FBI has wiretaps from the investigation of the Clinton Foundation. It’s finding new emails all the time. And Clintonworld panicked. The spinmeisters of Clintonworld have claimed that the email scandal is just so much smoke without fire. All that’s here is the appearance of impropriety without any of the substance. But this isn’t how you react to smoke. It’s how you respond to a fire. The misguided assault on the FBI tells us that Hillary Clinton and her allies are afraid of a revelation bigger than the fundamental illegality of her email setup. The email setup was a preemptive cover up. The Clinton campaign has panicked badly out of the belief | right or wrong | that whatever crime the illegal setup was meant to cover up is at risk of being exposed. The Clintons have weathered countless scandals over the years. Whatever they are protecting this time around is bigger than the usual corruption | bribery | sexual assaults and abuses of power that have followed them around throughout the years. This is bigger and more damaging than any of the allegations that have already come out. And they don’t want FBI investigators anywhere near it. The campaign against Comey is pure intimidation. It’s also a warning. Any senior FBI people who value their careers are being warned to stay away. The Democrats are closing ranks around their nominee against the FBI. It’s an ugly and unprecedented scene. It may also be their last stand. Hillary Clinton has awkwardly wound her way through numerous scandals in just this election cycle. But she’s never shown fear or desperation before. Now that has changed. Whatever she is afraid of | it lies buried in her emails with Huma Abedin. And it can bring her down like nothing else has.  ,FAKE,,,You Can Smell Hillary’s Fear Daniel Greenfield | a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center | is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam.

10294,Watch The Exact Moment Paul Ryan Committed Political Suicide At A Trump Rally (VIDEO),Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr There are two fundamental truths in this world: Paul Ryan desperately wants to be president. And Paul Ryan will never be president. Today proved it. In a particularly staggering example of political cowardice | Paul Ryan re-re-re-reversed course and announced that he was back on the Trump Train after all. This was an aboutface from where he was a few weeks ago. He had previously declared he would not be supporting or defending Trump after a tape was made public in which Trump bragged about assaulting women. Suddenly | Ryan was appearing at a pro-Trump rally and boldly declaring that he already sent in his vote to make him President of the United States. It was a surreal moment. The figurehead of the Republican Party dosed himself in gasoline | got up on a stage on a chilly afternoon in Wisconsin | and lit a match. . @SpeakerRyan says he voted for @realDonaldTrump : “Republicans | it is time to come home” https://t.co/VyTT49YvoE pic.twitter.com/wCvSCg4a5I — ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) November 5 | 2016 The Democratic Party couldn’t have asked for a better moment of film. Ryan’s chances of ever becoming president went down to zero in an instant. In the wreckage Trump is to leave behind in his wake | those who cravenly backed his campaign will not recover. If Ryan’s career manages to limp all the way to 2020 | then the DNC will have this tape locked and loaded to be used in every ad until Election Day. The ringing endorsement of the man he clearly hates on a personal level speaks volumes about his own spinelessness. Ryan has postured himself as a “principled” conservative | and one uncomfortable with Trump’s unapologetic bigotry and sexism. However | when push came to shove | Paul Ryan – like many of his colleagues – turned into a sniveling appeaser. After all his lofty tak about conviction | his principles were a house of cards and collapsed with the slightest breeze. What’s especially bizarre is how close Ryan came to making it through unscathed. For months the Speaker of the House refused to comment on Trump at all. His strategy seemed to be to keep his head down | pretend Trump didn’t exist | and hope that nobody remembered what happened in 2016. Now | just days away from the election | he screwed it all up. If 2016’s very ugly election has done any good it’s by exposing the utter cowardice of the Republicans who once feigned moral courage. A reality television star spit on them | hijacked their party | insulted their wives | and got every last one of them to kneel before him. What a turn of events.

3608,Kerry to go to Paris in gesture of sympathy,U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry said Monday that he will stop in Paris later this week | amid criticism that no top American officials attended Sunday’s unity march against terrorism.Kerry said he expects to arrive in Paris Thursday evening | as he heads home after a week abroad. He said he will fly to France at the conclusion of a series of meetings scheduled for Thursday in Sofia | Bulgaria. He plans to meet the next day with Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and President Francois Hollande | then return to Washington.The visit by Kerry | who has family and childhood ties to the country and speaks fluent French | could address some of the criticism that the United States snubbed France in its darkest hour in many years.The French press on Monday was filled with questions about why neither President Obama nor Kerry attended Sunday’s march | as about 40 leaders of other nations did. Obama was said to have stayed away because his own security needs can be taxing on a country | and Kerry had prior commitments.Among roughly 40 leaders who did attend was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu | no stranger to intense security | who marched beside Hollande through the city streets. The highest ranking U.S. officials attending the march were Jane Hartley | the ambassador to France | and Victoria Nuland | the assistant secretary of state for European affairs. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. was in Paris for meetings with law enforcement officials but did not participate in the march.Kerry spent Sunday at a business summit hosted by India’s prime minister | Narendra Modi. The United States is eager for India to relax stringent laws that function as barriers to foreign investment and hopes Modi’s government will act to open the huge Indian market for more American businesses.In a news conference | Kerry brushed aside criticism that the United States had not sent a more senior official to Paris as “quibbling a little bit.” He noted that many staffers of the American Embassy in Paris attended the march | including the ambassador. He said he had wanted to be present at the march himself but could not because of his prior commitments in India.“But that is why I am going there on the way home | to make it crystal clear how passionately we feel about the events that have taken place there |” he said.“And I don’t think the people of France have any doubts about America’s understanding of what happened | of our personal sense of loss and our deep commitment to the people of France in this moment of trauma.”,REAL,,,Kerry to go to Paris in gesture of sympathy U.S. Secretary of State John F.

Thanks for nothing | DNC!” The meme has been shared almost 15 |000 times in less than an hour: Posted by The Other 98% on Tuesday | November 8 | 2016 While Bernie Sanders endorsed Hillary Clinton just before the Democratic National Convention in July | many of his supporters remained adamant in their refusal to support the DNC-anointed candidate | pointing to WikiLeaks’ revelations that top officials at the DNC had been working behind the scenes to tip the scales in Clinton’s favor by coordinating with media figures to circulate anti-Sanders narratives. Rather than attribute a potential Trump presidency to the GOP nominee’s perceived popularity among voters | the closeness of this election could be credited to Hillary Clinton’s unfavorable ratings. According to RealClearPolitics | anywhere between 51 and 57 percent of voters had a negative opinion of the Democratic nominee. As of 11 PM Eastern | Florida | Michigan | Pennsylvania | and Wisconsin remain too close to call. Clinton has 197 electoral votes to Trump’s 187.

Thanks for nothing | DNC!” The meme has been shared almost 15 |000 times in less than an hour: Posted by The Other 98% on Tuesday | November 8 | 2016 While Bernie Sanders endorsed Hillary Clinton just before the Democratic National Convention in July | many of his supporters remained adamant in their refusal to support the DNC-anointed candidate | pointing to WikiLeaks’ revelations that top officials at the DNC had been working behind the scenes to tip the scales in Clinton’s favor by coordinating with media figures to circulate anti-Sanders narratives. Rather than attribute a potential Trump presidency to the GOP nominee’s perceived popularity among voters | the closeness of this election could be credited to Hillary Clinton’s unfavorable ratings. According to RealClearPolitics | anywhere between 51 and 57 percent of voters had a negative opinion of the Democratic nominee. As of 11 PM Eastern | Florida | Michigan | Pennsylvania | and Wisconsin remain too close to call. Clinton has 197 electoral votes to Trump’s 187.

6903,Tehran | USA,  I’m not an immigrant | but my grandparents are. More than 50 years ago | they arrived in New York City from Iran. I grew up mainly in central New Jersey | an American kid playing little league for the Raritan Red Sox and soccer for the Raritan Rovers. In 1985 | I travelled with my family to our ancestral land. I was only eight | but old enough to understand that the Iranians had lost their liberty and freedom. I saw the abject despair of a people who | in a desperate attempt to bring about change | had ushered in nationalist tyrants led by Ayatollah Khomeini. What I witnessed during that year in Iran changed the course of my life. In 1996 | at age 19 | wanting to help preserve the blessings of liberty and freedom we enjoy in America | I enlisted in the U.S. Navy. Now | with the rise of Donald Trump and his nationalist alt-right movement | I’ve come to feel that the values I sought to protect are in jeopardy. In Iran | theocratic fundmentalists sowed division and hatred of outsiders — of Westerners | Christians | and other religious minorities. Here in America | the right wing seems to have stolen passages directly from their playbook as it spreads hatred of immigrants | particularly Muslim ones. This form of nationalistic bigotry — Islamophobia — threatens the heart of our nation. When I chose to serve in the military | I did so to protect what I viewed as our sacred foundational values of liberty | equality | and democracy. Now | 20 years later | I’ve joined forces with fellow veterans to again fight for those sacred values | this time right here at home. “Death to America!” As a child | I sat in my class at the international school one sunny morning and heard in the distance the faint sounds of gunfire and rising chants of “Death to America!” That day would define the rest of my life. It was Tehran | the capital of Iran | in 1985. I was attending a unique school for bilingual students who had been born in Western nations. It had become the last refuge in that city with any tolerance for Western teaching | but that also made it a target for military fundamentalists. As the gunfire drew closer | I heard boots pounding the marble tiles outside | marching into our building | and thundering down the corridor toward my classroom. As I heard voices chanting “Death to America!” I remember wondering if I would survive to see my parents again. In a flash of green and black uniforms | those soldiers rushed into our classroom | grabbed us by our shirt collars | and yelled at us to get outside. We were then packed into the school’s courtyard where a soldier pointed his rifle at our group and commanded us to look up. Almost in unison | my classmates and I raised our eyes and saw the flags of our many nations being torn down and dangled from the balcony | then set ablaze and tossed | still burning | into the courtyard. As those flags floated to the ground in flames | the soldiers fired their guns in the air. Shouting | they ordered us — if we ever wanted to see our families again — to swear allegiance to the Grand Ayatollah Khomeini and trample on the remains of the burning symbols of our home countries. I scanned the smoke that was filling the courtyard for my friends and classmates and | horrified | watched them capitulate and begin to chant | “Death to America!” as they stomped on our sacred symbols. I was so angry that | young as I was | I began to plead with them to come to their senses. No one paid the slightest attention to an eight year old and yet | for the first time in my life | I felt something like righteous indignation. I suspect that | born and raised in America | I was already imbued with such a sense of privilege that I just couldn’t fathom the immense danger I was in. Certainly | I was acting in ways no native Iranian would have found reasonable. Across the smoke-filled courtyard | I saw a soldier coming at me and knew he meant to force me to submit. I spotted an American flag still burning | dropped to my knees | and grabbed the charred pieces from underneath a classmate’s feet. As the soldier closed in on me | I ducked and ran | still clutching my charred pieces of flag into a crowd of civilians who had gathered to witness the commotion. The events of that day would come to define all that I have ever stood for — or against. “Camel Jockey |” “Ayatollah |” and “Gandhi” My parents and I soon returned to the United States and I entered third grade. More than anything | I just wanted to be normal | to fit in and be accepted by my peers. Unfortunately | my first name | Nader (which I changed to Nate upon joining the Navy) | and my swarthy Middle Eastern appearance | were little help on that score | eliciting regular jibes from my classmates. Even at that young age | they had already mastered a veritable thesaurus of ethnic defamation | including “camel jockey |” “sand-nigger |” “raghead |” “ayatollah |” and ironically | “Gandhi” (which I now take as a compliment). My classmates regularly sought to “other-ize” me in those years | as if I were a lesser American because of my faith and ethnicity. Yet I remember that tingling in my chest when I first donned my Cub Scout uniform — all because of the American flag patch on its shoulder. Something felt so good about wearing it | a feeling I still had when I joined the military. It seems that the flag I tried to rescue in Tehran was stapled to my heart | or that’s how I felt anyway as I wore my country’s uniform. When I took my oath of enlistment in the U.S. Navy | I gave my mom a camera and asked her to take some photos | but she was so overwhelmed with pride and joy that she cried throughout the ceremony and managed to snap only a few images of the carpet. She cried even harder when I was selected to serve as the first Muslim-American member of the U.S. Navy Presidential Ceremonial Honor Guard . On that day | I was proud | too | and all the taunts of those bullies of my childhood seemed finally silenced. Being tormented because of my ethnicity and religion in those early years had another effect on me. It caused me to become unusually sensitive to the nature of other people. Somehow | I grasped that | if it weren’t for a fear of the unknown | there was an inherent goodness and frail humanity lurking in many of the kids who bullied and harassed me. Often | I discovered | those same bullies could be tremendously kind to their families | friends | or even strangers. I realized | then | that if | despite everything | I could lay myself bare and trust them enough to reach out in kindness | I might in turn gain their trust and they might then see me | too | and stop operating from such a place of fear and hate. Through patience | humor | and understanding | I was able to offer myself as the embodiment of my people and somehow defang the “otherness” of so much that Americans found scary. To this day | I have friends from elementary school | middle school | high school | and the military who tell me that I am the only Muslim they have ever known and that | had they not met me | their perspective on Islam would have been wholly subject to the prevailing fear-based narrative that has poisoned this country since September 11 | 2001. In 1998 | I became special assistant to the Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy and then | in 1999 | I was recruited to serve at the Defense Intelligence Agency. In August 2000 | I transferred to the Naval Reserve. In the wake of 9/11 | I began to observe how so many of my fellow Americans were adopting a fundamentalist “us vs. them” attitude towards Muslims and Islam. I suddenly found myself in an America where the scattered insults I had endured as a child took on an overarching and sinister meaning and form | where they became something like an ideology and way of life. By the time I completed my military service in 2006 | I had begun to understand that our policies in the Middle East |similarly disturbed | seemed in pursuit of little more than perpetual warfare. That | in turn | was made possible by the creation of a new enemy: Islam — or rather of a portrait | painted by the powers-that-be | of Islam as a terror religion | as a hooded villain lurking out there somewhere in the desert | waiting to destroy us. I knew that attempting to dispel | through the patient approach of my childhood | the kind of Islamophobia that now had the country by the throat was not going to be enough. Post-9/11 attacks on Muslims in the U.S. and elsewhere were not merely childish taunts. For the first time in my life | in a country gripped by fear | I believed I was witnessing a shift | en masse | toward an American fundamentalism and ultra-nationalism that reflected a wanton lack of reason | not to mention fact. As a boy in Iran | I had witnessed the dark destination down which such a path could take a country. Now | it seemed to me | in America’s quest to escape the very demons we had sown by our own misadventures in the Middle East | and forsaking the hallmarks of our founding | we risked becoming everything we sought to defeat. The Boy in the Schoolyard Grown Up On February 10 | 2015 | three young American students | Yusor Abu-Salha | Razan Abu-Salha | and Deah Shaddy Barakat | were executed at an apartment complex in Chapel Hill | North Carolina. The killer was a gun-crazy white man filled with hate and described by his own daughter as “a monster.” Those assassinations struck a special chord of sorrow and loss in me. My mom and I cried and prayed together for those students and their families. The incident in Chapel Hill also awoke in me some version of the righteous indignation I had felt so many years earlier in that smoke-filled courtyard in Iran. I would be damned if I stood by while kids in my country were murdered simply because of their faith. It violated every word of the oath I had taken when I joined the military and desecrated every value I held in my heart as a sacred tenet of our nation. White nationalists and bigots had | by then | thrown down the gauntlet for so much of this | using Islamophobia to trigger targeted assassinations in the United States. This was terrorism | pure and simple | inspired by hate-speakers here at home. At that moment | I reached out to fellow veterans who | I thought | might be willing to help — and it’s true what they say about soul mates being irrevocably drawn to each other. When I contacted Veterans For Peace  | an organization dedicated to exposing the costs of war and militarism | I found the leadership well aware of the inherent dangers of Islamophobia and of the need to confront this new enemy. So Executive Director Michael McPhearson formed a committee of vets from around the country to decide how those of us who had donned uniforms to defend this land could best battle the phenomenon — and I | of course | joined it. From that committee emerged Veterans Challenge Islamophobia (VCI). It now has organizers in Arizona | Georgia | New Jersey | and Texas | and that’s just a beginning. Totally nonpartisan | VCI focuses on politicians of any party who engage in hate speech. We’ve met with leaders of American Muslim communities | sat with them through Ramadan | and attended their Iftar dinners to break our fasts together. In the wake of the Orlando shooting  | we at VCI also mobilized to fight back against attempts to pit the Muslim community against the LGBTQ+ community. Our group was born of the belief that | as American military veterans | we had a responsibility to call out bigotry | hatred | and the perpetuation of endless warfare. We want the American Muslim community to know that they have allies | and that those allies are indeed veterans as well. We stand with them and for them and | for those of us who are Muslim | among them. Nationalism and xenophobia have no place in American life | and I | for my part | don’t think Donald Trump or anyone like him should be able to peddle Islamophobia in an attempt to undermine our national unity. Without Islamophobia | there no longer exists a “clash of civilizations.” Without Islamophobia | whatever the problems in the world may be | there is no longer an “us vs. them” and it’s possible to begin reimagining a world of something other than perpetual war. As of now | this remains the struggle of my life | for despite my intense love for America | some of my countrymen increasingly see American Muslims as the “other |” the enemy. My Mom taught me as a boy that the only thing that mattered was what was in my heart. Now | with her in mind and as a representative of VCI | when I meet fellow Americans I always remember my childhood experiences with my bullying peers. And I still lay myself bare | as I did then. I give trust to gain trust | but always knowing that these days this isn’t just a matter of niceties. It’s a question of life or death. It’s part of a battle for the soul of our nation. In many ways | I still consider myself that boy in the school courtyard in Tehran trying to rescue charred pieces of that flag from those trampling feet. It’s just that now I’m doing it in my own country. Nate Terani is a veteran of the U.S. Navy and served in military intelligence with the Defense Intelligence Agency.

7341,Girl Horrified At What She Watches Boyfriend Do After He Left FaceTime On,Share This Baylee Luciani (left) | Screenshot of what Baylee caught on FaceTime (right) The closest Baylee Luciani could get to her boyfriend | who’s attending college in Austin | was through video online chat. The couple had regular “dates” this way to bridge the 200-mile distance between them. However | the endearing arrangement quickly came to an end after his FaceTime was left on and caught something that left his girlfriend horrified. Baylee had been discussing regular things with her boyfriend | Yale Gerstein | who was on the other side of the screen on an otherwise average evening. This video chat was not unlike all the others she had with Yale from his apartment near Austin Community College until the 19-year-old girlfriend heard some scratching sounds after FaceTime had been left on. According to KRON  | Baylee was mid-conversation with Yale when scratches at the door caught both of their attention and he got up from his bed | where the computer was | to see who was at his door. He barely turned the handle to open in when masked men entered the room and beat Yale’s face in and slammed him down on his bed while shoving a pistol in his cheek. The intruders didn’t seem to know or care that FaceTime was still on and Baylee’s face | seen in the corner | was watching everything | terrified that she was about to see her boyfriend murdered in front of her | as she watched him fight for his life. Admitting that she first thought it was a joke | seconds later | she came to the horrid realization that he was being robbed and called her dad | who was at home with her in Dallas | into the room. “I was scared | because they were saying I’m going to blow your head off | I’m going to kill you |” Baylee explained along with the chilling feeling she got when the intruder finally realized the video chat was running and looked right at her in the camera. “I’m like wow… seriously watching an armed robbery happen to somebody that I care about |” she added. Screengrabs of intruder forcing Yale down on his bed while Baylee and her father watch on FaceTime in horror With a clear view of at least one intruder’s face | Baylee began taking screenshots of the suspect in the act as she and her dad called the police to report what was going on. She got the pictures right in time since | seconds later | the intruder decided to disconnect the computer as he and the suspects took off with thousands of dollars worth of Yale’s music equipment. Although the boyfriend’s life was spared in the traumatizing ordeal for the two of them | he said that the thieves took something from him that can’t be replaced. “I had just finished my first album as a solo artist |” Yale said. “That’s all lost |” since they took the recordings on the equipment | which means nothing to the thieves and everything to the victim. It’s not often that you hear of FaceTime solving crimes or potentially saving lives | which is what happened in this case. Although it was difficult to watch | Baylee | being there through technology | was an instrumental part in protecting Yale | who hopefully learned that he better take advantage of Texas’ great gun laws and arm himself with more than just a computer.,FAKE,,,Girl Horrified At What She Watches Boyfriend Do After He Left FaceTime On Share This Baylee Luciani (left) | Screenshot of what Baylee caught on FaceTime (right) The closest Baylee Luciani could get to her boyfriend | who’s attending college in Austin | was through video online chat.

4869,Fact check: Trump and Clinton at the 'commander-in-chief' forum,Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump made some inaccurate claims during an NBC “commander-in-chief” forum on military and veterans issues:• Clinton wrongly claimed Trump supported the war in Iraq after it started | while Trump was wrong | once again | in saying he was against the war before it started.• Trump said that President Obama set a “certain date” for withdrawing troops from Iraq | when that date was set before Obama was sworn in.• Trump said that Obama’s visits to China | Saudi Arabia and Cuba were “the first time in the history | the storied history of Air Force One” when “high officials” of a host country did not appear to greet the president. Not true.• Clinton said that Trump supports privatizing the Veterans Health Administration. That’s false. Trump said he supports allowing veterans to seek care at either public or private hospitals.• Trump said Clinton made “a terrible mistake on Libya” when she was secretary of State. But | at the time | Trump also supported U.S. action that led to the removal of Moammar Gadhafi from power.• Trump cherry-picked Clinton’s words when he claimed Clinton said “vets are being treated | essentially | just fine.” Clinton had said the problems in the Department of Veterans Affairs were not as “widespread” as some Republicans claimed | but she went on to acknowledge problems | including the issue of wait times for doctors.The forum | sponsored by NBC News and the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America | was held Sept. 7 at the Intrepid Sea | Air & Space Museum in New York City. Today show host Matt Lauer | and members of the military and veterans in the audience | questioned the candidates separately.Trump said he “was totally against the war in Iraq |” while Clinton claimed that he supported the Iraq War before and after it started. The facts don’t support either candidate’s strong assertions.Our review of Trump’s statements before and after the Iraq War started found no evidence that Trump opposed the war before it started. In fact | he expressed mild support for invading Iraq when asked about it on the Howard Stern radio show on Sept. 11 | 2002 — about six months before the war started.Stern asked Trump if he supported a war with Iraq | and Trump responded | “Yeah | I guess so.”In the NBC commander in chief forum | Trump cited an Esquire article that appeared in August 2004 to show his opposition to the war. But that article appeared 17 months after the war started.As for Clinton | who as a senator voted in October 2002 to authorize the war in Iraq | the Democratic nominee claimed that Trump “supported it before it happened | he supported it as it was happening and he is on record as supporting it after it happened.”But just as there is no evidence that Trump opposed the Iraq War before it started | the Clinton campaign offered no evidence that Trump supported the war “after it happened.”The Clinton campaign cited Trump’s interview on March 21 | 2003 | with Neil Cavuto of Fox Business just two days after the war started.Cavuto asked Trump about the impact of the war on the stock market. Trump said the war “looks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint |” and he predicted the market will “go up like a rocket” after the war. But Cavuto does not ask Trump whether the U.S. should have gone to war with Iraq or whether he supports the war | and Trump doesn’t offer an opinion.As early as July 2003 | Trump expressed concern on Hardball with Chris Matthews about money being spent in Iraq rather than in the U.S. Two months later | Trump told MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough | “I guess maybe if I had to do it | I would have fought terrorism but not necessarily Iraq.”Clinton invited her audience to read Trump’s comments on the Iraq War. They can read our timeline | “Donald Trump and the Iraq War.”Trump said President Obama set a “certain date” for withdrawing troops from Iraq | but that date was actually set by President George W. Bush.NBC’s Matt Lauer asked Trump about his tendency to respond | when pushed for details on his military proposals | that he’s not going to give details because he wants to be “unpredictable.” Trump responded | “Absolutely |” and went on to criticize Obama for revealing the withdrawal date.As we said then | Republicans and Democrats disagree on whether Obama or Bush is to blame for withdrawing all combat troops from Iraq at the end of 2011. But that date was set when Bush signed the Status of Forces Agreement on Dec. 14 | 2008. It said: “All the United States Forces shall withdraw from all Iraqi territory no later than December 31 | 2011.”In the NBC forum | Trump also called the withdrawal of troops “a terrible decision.” As we’ve explained before | Condoleezza Rice | Bush’s secretary of State | later wrote that Bush wanted an agreement for a residual force to remain | but Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki objected.Once Obama took office in January 2009 | he had three years to renegotiate the deal | which his administration tried to do | to leave a residual American troop force. But Maliki still didn’t agree. Negotiations broke down in October 2011 over the issue of whether U.S. troops would be shielded from criminal prosecution by Iraqi authorities. Whether Obama did enough is a matter of opinion: His then defense secretary | Leon Panetta | later wrote that the president didn’t press hard enough for a deal. But some experts say Iraq was more closely aligned at the time with Iran and there wasn’t a deal to be made with Maliki.So | both presidents had a role in the withdrawal of troops. But Trump wrongly said that Obama was the one who set a “certain date” for withdrawal and let U.S. enemies know about it | when that date was set before Obama was sworn in.It’s worth noting that Trump said in a March 16 | 2007 | interview on CNN that the troops should be withdrawn quickly from Iraq.Trump said that Obama’s visits to China | Saudi Arabia and Cuba were “the first time in the history | the storied history of Air Force One” when “high officials” of a host country did not appear to greet the president.That’s not true. Other presidents have encountered similar low-key greetings on foreign trips aboard the presidential aircraft.Trump referred to the fact that Cuba’s president | Raul Castro | did not greet Obama at the airport on his historic visit to Cuba in March | that Saudi Arabia’s King Salman did not meet Air Force One at the start of Obama’s trip to Riyadh in April | and he referred to China’s handling of the president’s arrival in Hangzhou last Saturday for a Group of 20 meeting.Whether or not those arrivals constituted snubs of a U.S. president as Trump claims is a matter of debate. But Trump is wrong on the facts when he claims it has not happened before. It has.In 1984 | for example | Ronald Reagan landed in Beijing and was received by China’s foreign minister rather than the president | whom he met only later. Similarly | on a 1985 trip to West Germany | Reagan was met by the foreign minister and not Chancellor Helmut Kohl.These and other examples were dug up by our friend Glenn Kessler | the Washington Post‘s “Fact Checker |” who researched a Trump claim in April that Cuba’s and Saudi Arabia’s handling of Obama’s visits were “without precedent.” Kessler said of Trump | “once again he’s wrong | wrong | wrong.”Kessler also noted that during Richard Nixon’s historic 1972 visit to China he was greeted at the airport by the country’s number two man | Premier Zhou Enlai. His boss | Chairman Mao | didn’t even agree to meet with Nixon until after he had arrived at a guest house.Clinton said that her plan to overhaul the Veterans Health Administration would not include privatization | which she said Trump supports.But Trump refuted that statement when it was his turn to discuss his plan to help veterans. “I would not do that |” Trump said | referring to Clinton’s claim that he supports privatization.Trump’s campaign published “The Goals Of Donald J. Trump’s Veterans Plan” on its website last October. It doesn’t call for the VA to be completely privatized.One of the biggest changes that plan would make to the current VA health care system is allowing veterans to get care at any non-VA medical center that accepts Medicare.“Under a Trump Administration | all veterans eligible for VA health care can bring their veteran’s ID card to any doctor or care facility that accepts Medicare to get the care they need immediately |” the plan states.“The power to choose will stop the wait time backlogs and force the VA to improve and compete if the department wants to keep receiving veterans’ healthcare dollars |” the plan says.Trump’s proposal would seemingly go further than the Non-VA Medical Care Program | which allows eligible veterans to access care outside of the VA under certain circumstances | such as when VA medical centers cannot provide services. The program requires pre-approval for veterans to receive care at a non-VA facility in non-emergency situations.Trump’s proposal would also go further than the bipartisan Veterans Choice Act of 2014 that President Obama signed into law | creating a temporary program | separate from the Non-VA Medical Care Program | that allows eligible veterans to receive health care at a non-VA facility if they would have to wait more than 30 days for an appointment at a VA medical center | or if they live more than 40 miles from the nearest VA hospital.Trump stuck to the idea of allowing veterans to choose between public and private hospitals when he released his most recent “Ten Point Plan To Reform The VA” in July.Point 10 of the plan says: “Mr. Trump will ensure every veteran has the choice to seek care at the VA or at a private service provider of their own choice. Under a Trump Administration | no veteran will die waiting for service.”Trump reinforced that part of his plan during the NBC News forum as well.To be clear | Trump supports giving veterans a choice between VA hospitals and private ones. That’s not the same thing as supporting the complete privatization of the system that provides care to veterans.Trump criticized Clinton for making “a terrible mistake on Libya” when she was secretary of State. But | at the time | Trump also supported U.S. action that led to the removal of Moammar Gadhafi from power.Trump made his claim in response to a question posed by Lauer on whether Trump will be “prepared on Day One |” if elected president | to tackle “complex national security issues.”This isn’t the first time Trump has ignored his past support for the U.S. intervention in Libya.During the 10th GOP debate | Trump said he had “never discussed that subject” when Sen. Ted Cruz called him out on supporting U.S. action in the country. But | as we wrote | Trump said in 2011 that the U.S. should go into Libya “on a humanitarian basis” and “knock [Gadhafi] out very quickly | very surgically | very effectively and save the lives.”Trump made that comment in a video posted to his YouTube channel in February 2011:Even though Trump now says Clinton’s support for intervention in Libya was a “terrible mistake |” it doesn’t change the fact that five years ago he supported Gadhafi’s removal.Trump twisted Clinton’s words when he claimed Clinton said “vets are being treated | essentially | just fine.” Clinton said the problems in the Department of Veterans Affairs were not as “widespread” as some Republican supporters of privatization of the VA claim | but she went on to acknowledge problems in the VA system — including the issue of wait times for doctors — and what she would do to address them.Trump highlighted the issue of wait times to see a doctor as “one of the big problems” in the VA | and then suggested Clinton doesn’t think the VA has problems.Lauer interrupted | noting that Clinton “went on after that and laid out a litany of problems within the VA.”Trump insisted his version was accurate | adding | “I’m telling you … she said she was satisfied with what was going on in the Veterans Administration.”That’s not accurate. The comments in question from Clinton came during an interview with MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on Oct. 23 | 2015. Maddow asked about talk among some Republicans of abolishing the VA and privatizing it. “The reason they are able to propose something that radical is because the problems at the VA seem so intractable |” Maddow said.Maddow asked if Clinton had any “new ideas for trying to fix” the VA. Here was Clinton’s response | with the part Trump is referring to in bold.Clinton accused Republicans of underfunding the VA because they “want it to fail” so they can privatize it.Clinton added | “But we have to be more creative about trying to fix the problems that are the legitimate concern | so that we can try to stymie the Republican assault.”Indeed | the Clinton campaign website states that Clinton wants to “fundamentally reform veterans’ health care to ensure access to timely and high quality care.” The campaign says Clinton “was outraged by the recent scandals at the VA | and as president | she will demand accountability and performance from VA leadership.” The site specifically mentions Clinton’s dissatisfaction that “[m]any veterans have to wait an unacceptably long time to see a doctor or to process disability claims and appeals” and promises she will “[b]uild a 21st-century Department of Veterans Affairs to deliver world-class care.”Trump cherry-picked the part of Clinton’s response that said problems in the VA have “not been as widespread as it has been made out to be |” to make the blanket claim that Clinton is “satisfied with what was going on in the Veterans Administration” and that “vets are being treated | essentially | just fine.” But Trump is leaving out the parts of Clinton’s answer that acknowledged problems in the VA — including the wait time issue Trump highlighted as one of his biggest concerns.,REAL,,,Fact check: Trump and Clinton at the 'commander-in-chief' forum Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump made some inaccurate claims during an NBC “commander-in-chief” forum on military and veterans issues:• Clinton wrongly claimed Trump supported the war in Iraq after it started | while Trump was wrong | once again | in saying he was against the war before it started.• Trump said that President Obama set a “certain date” for withdrawing troops from Iraq | when that date was set before Obama was sworn in.• Trump said that Obama’s visits to China | Saudi Arabia and Cuba were “the first time in the history | the storied history of Air Force One” when “high officials” of a host country did not appear to greet the president.

But Trump wrongly said that Obama was the one who set a “certain date” for withdrawal and let U.S. enemies know about it | when that date was set before Obama was sworn in.It’s worth noting that Trump said in a March 16 | 2007 | interview on CNN that the troops should be withdrawn quickly from Iraq.Trump said that Obama’s visits to China | Saudi Arabia and Cuba were “the first time in the history | the storied history of Air Force One” when “high officials” of a host country did not appear to greet the president.That’s not true. Other presidents have encountered similar low-key greetings on foreign trips aboard the presidential aircraft.Trump referred to the fact that Cuba’s president | Raul Castro | did not greet Obama at the airport on his historic visit to Cuba in March | that Saudi Arabia’s King Salman did not meet Air Force One at the start of Obama’s trip to Riyadh in April | and he referred to China’s handling of the president’s arrival in Hangzhou last Saturday for a Group of 20 meeting.Whether or not those arrivals constituted snubs of a U.S. president as Trump claims is a matter of debate. But Trump is wrong on the facts when he claims it has not happened before. It has.In 1984 | for example | Ronald Reagan landed in Beijing and was received by China’s foreign minister rather than the president | whom he met only later. Similarly | on a 1985 trip to West Germany | Reagan was met by the foreign minister and not Chancellor Helmut Kohl.These and other examples were dug up by our friend Glenn Kessler | the Washington Post‘s “Fact Checker |” who researched a Trump claim in April that Cuba’s and Saudi Arabia’s handling of Obama’s visits were “without precedent.” Kessler said of Trump | “once again he’s wrong | wrong | wrong.”Kessler also noted that during Richard Nixon’s historic 1972 visit to China he was greeted at the airport by the country’s number two man | Premier Zhou Enlai. His boss | Chairman Mao | didn’t even agree to meet with Nixon until after he had arrived at a guest house.Clinton said that her plan to overhaul the Veterans Health Administration would not include privatization | which she said Trump supports.But Trump refuted that statement when it was his turn to discuss his plan to help veterans. “I would not do that |” Trump said | referring to Clinton’s claim that he supports privatization.Trump’s campaign published “The Goals Of Donald J. Trump’s Veterans Plan” on its website last October. It doesn’t call for the VA to be completely privatized.One of the biggest changes that plan would make to the current VA health care system is allowing veterans to get care at any non-VA medical center that accepts Medicare.“Under a Trump Administration | all veterans eligible for VA health care can bring their veteran’s ID card to any doctor or care facility that accepts Medicare to get the care they need immediately |” the plan states.“The power to choose will stop the wait time backlogs and force the VA to improve and compete if the department wants to keep receiving veterans’ healthcare dollars |” the plan says.Trump’s proposal would seemingly go further than the Non-VA Medical Care Program | which allows eligible veterans to access care outside of the VA under certain circumstances | such as when VA medical centers cannot provide services. The program requires pre-approval for veterans to receive care at a non-VA facility in non-emergency situations.Trump’s proposal would also go further than the bipartisan Veterans Choice Act of 2014 that President Obama signed into law | creating a temporary program | separate from the Non-VA Medical Care Program | that allows eligible veterans to receive health care at a non-VA facility if they would have to wait more than 30 days for an appointment at a VA medical center | or if they live more than 40 miles from the nearest VA hospital.Trump stuck to the idea of allowing veterans to choose between public and private hospitals when he released his most recent “Ten Point Plan To Reform The VA” in July.Point 10 of the plan says: “Mr. Trump will ensure every veteran has the choice to seek care at the VA or at a private service provider of their own choice. Under a Trump Administration | no veteran will die waiting for service.”Trump reinforced that part of his plan during the NBC News forum as well.To be clear | Trump supports giving veterans a choice between VA hospitals and private ones. That’s not the same thing as supporting the complete privatization of the system that provides care to veterans.Trump criticized Clinton for making “a terrible mistake on Libya” when she was secretary of State. But | at the time | Trump also supported U.S. action that led to the removal of Moammar Gadhafi from power.Trump made his claim in response to a question posed by Lauer on whether Trump will be “prepared on Day One |” if elected president | to tackle “complex national security issues.”This isn’t the first time Trump has ignored his past support for the U.S. intervention in Libya.During the 10th GOP debate | Trump said he had “never discussed that subject” when Sen. Ted Cruz called him out on supporting U.S. action in the country. But | as we wrote | Trump said in 2011 that the U.S. should go into Libya “on a humanitarian basis” and “knock [Gadhafi] out very quickly | very surgically | very effectively and save the lives.”Trump made that comment in a video posted to his YouTube channel in February 2011:Even though Trump now says Clinton’s support for intervention in Libya was a “terrible mistake |” it doesn’t change the fact that five years ago he supported Gadhafi’s removal.Trump twisted Clinton’s words when he claimed Clinton said “vets are being treated | essentially | just fine.” Clinton said the problems in the Department of Veterans Affairs were not as “widespread” as some Republican supporters of privatization of the VA claim | but she went on to acknowledge problems in the VA system — including the issue of wait times for doctors — and what she would do to address them.Trump highlighted the issue of wait times to see a doctor as “one of the big problems” in the VA | and then suggested Clinton doesn’t think the VA has problems.Lauer interrupted | noting that Clinton “went on after that and laid out a litany of problems within the VA.”Trump insisted his version was accurate | adding | “I’m telling you … she said she was satisfied with what was going on in the Veterans Administration.”That’s not accurate. The comments in question from Clinton came during an interview with MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on Oct. 23 | 2015. Maddow asked about talk among some Republicans of abolishing the VA and privatizing it. “The reason they are able to propose something that radical is because the problems at the VA seem so intractable |” Maddow said.Maddow asked if Clinton had any “new ideas for trying to fix” the VA. Here was Clinton’s response | with the part Trump is referring to in bold.Clinton accused Republicans of underfunding the VA because they “want it to fail” so they can privatize it.Clinton added | “But we have to be more creative about trying to fix the problems that are the legitimate concern | so that we can try to stymie the Republican assault.”Indeed | the Clinton campaign website states that Clinton wants to “fundamentally reform veterans’ health care to ensure access to timely and high quality care.” The campaign says Clinton “was outraged by the recent scandals at the VA | and as president | she will demand accountability and performance from VA leadership.” The site specifically mentions Clinton’s dissatisfaction that “[m]any veterans have to wait an unacceptably long time to see a doctor or to process disability claims and appeals” and promises she will “[b]uild a 21st-century Department of Veterans Affairs to deliver world-class care.”Trump cherry-picked the part of Clinton’s response that said problems in the VA have “not been as widespread as it has been made out to be |” to make the blanket claim that Clinton is “satisfied with what was going on in the Veterans Administration” and that “vets are being treated | essentially | just fine.” But Trump is leaving out the parts of Clinton’s answer that acknowledged problems in the VA — including the wait time issue Trump highlighted as one of his biggest concerns.,fact check trump clinton commander-in-chief forum hillary clinton donald trump make inaccurate claim nbc “commander-in-chief” forum

2909,Iran reportedly makes new push for uranium concessions in nuclear talks,Iranian negotiators reportedly have made a last-ditch push for more concessions from the U.S. and five other world powers as talks on the fate of Iran's nuclear program come down to the final days before a crucial deadline.The New York Times reported late Sunday that Tehran had backed away from a tentative promise to ship a large portion of its uranium stockpile to Russia | where it could not be used as part of any future weapons program. Western officials insisted to the paper that the uranium did not have to be sent overseas | but could be disposed of in other ways.The new twist in the talks comes just two days before the deadline for both sides to agree on a framework for a permanent deal. The final deadline for a permanent deal would not arrive until the end of June.However | if Iran insists on keeping its uranium in the country | it would undermine a key argument made in favor of the deal by the Obama administration. The Times reports that if the uranium had gone to Russia | it would have been converted into fuel rods | which are difficult to use in nuclear weapons. It is not clear what would happen to the uranium if it remained in Iran.The Associated Press reported Sunday that Iran's position had shifted from from demanding that it be allowed to keep nearly 10 |000 centrifuges enriching uranium | to agreeing to keep 6 |000. Western officials involved in the talks told the Associated Press that Tehran may be ready to accept an even lower number.The United States and its allies want a deal that extends the time Iran would need to make a nuclear weapon from the present two months to three months to at least a year. However | The Times reported Sunday that a paper published by Olli Heinonen | former head of inspections for the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog | estimated that Iran could still develop a nuclear weapon in seven or eight months with around 6 |500 centrifuges.Tehran says it wants to enrich uranium only for energy | science | industry and medicine. But many countries fear Iran could use the technology to make weapons-grade uranium.Officials told the Associated Press that another main dispute involved the length of an agreement. Iran | they said | wants a total lifting of all caps on its activities after 10 years | while the U.S. and the five other nations at the talks — Russia | China | Britain | France and Germany — insist on progressive removal after a decade.A senior U.S. official characterized the issue as lack of agreement on what happens in years 11 to 15. The official spoke on condition of anonymity in line with State Department rules on briefing about the closed-door talks.Limits on Iran's research and development of centrifuges also were unresolved | the Western officials said.Tehran has created a prototype centrifuge that it says enriches uranium 16 times faster than its present mainstay model. The U.S. and its partners want to constrain research that would increase greatly the speed of making enough weapons-grade uranium for a bomb | once limits on Iran's programs are lifted.One official said Russia opposed the U.S. position that any U.N. penalties lifted in the course of a deal should be reimposed quickly if Tehran reneged on any commitments.Both Western officials said Iran was resisting attempts to make inspections and other ways of verification as intrusive as possible.There was tentative agreement on turning a nearly-finished reactor into a model that gives off less plutonium waste than originally envisaged. Plutonium | like enriched uranium | is a path to nuclear weapons.Iran and the U.S. were discussing letting Iran run centrifuges at an underground bunker that has been used to enrich uranium. The machines would produce isotopes for peaceful applications | the officials said.With the Tuesday deadline approaching and problems remaining | U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry canceled plans Sunday to return to the United States for an event honoring the late U.S. Sen.

988,Donald Trump’s Shockingly Weak Delegate Game Somehow Got Even Worse,Donald Trump’s organizational problems have gone from bad to worse to flat-out embarrassing. Here’s Politico with the play-by-play from this weekend’s Colorado GOP convention | the latest scene of Trump’s delegate-securing failure:Unlike in most other states | Republicans in Colorado scrapped plans for a more traditional primary or caucus to award its delegates to this summer’s national convention in Cleveland. Instead | the state GOP selected three delegates from each of the state’s seven congressional districts at individual contests in the days leading up to the state convention | and then the remaining 13 delegates at the statewide event this past weekend. It was a rather convoluted process that favored campaigns that understood the rules and that had the ground game necessary to take advantage of them—or | put another way | not the Trump campaign.At the first two district-level contests | the billionaire’s team showed up without an approved list of delegates to pass out to attendees | leaving supporters unsure of whom to back. And then at last Thursday’s contest | two of the three delegates on the Trump campaign’s list weren’t actually on the official ballot since they failed to pay the necessary registration fees.This past weekend’s mix-up | though | was an even bigger embarrassment since at least one of the seven misnumbered names on the Trump-sanctioned list lined up with a Cruz-supporting delegate | according to NBC News. (Even without that mix-up | though | Cruz would have likely swept the contest anyway given his well-oiled delegate-selecting machine.) The Trump camp | though | appeared to blame the state GOP for the mistake | pointing to discrepancies between the delegate guides posted on the party's website and the printed materials distributed at the event. “We'll do whatever it takes to protect the legitimacy of our support in Colorado |” Trump aide Alan Cobb told NBC | suggesting the campaign may challenge the results. “Clearly there are some serious issues with the ballot and balloting.”Trump remains the favorite to arrive at the convention with the most delegates to his name | but he’s far from assured of the majority of delegates he’d need to win the nomination on the first ballot. Given that reality | the GOP front-runner recently retooled his campaign to address his clear weaknesses in the under-the-radar battle to send loyal delegates to the convention. If those efforts don't start paying dividends soon | though | Trump very well may arrive in Cleveland with the most delegates—and leave without the nomination.,REAL,,,Donald Trump’s Shockingly Weak Delegate Game Somehow Got Even Worse Donald Trump’s organizational problems have gone from bad to worse to flat-out embarrassing.

4739,How women lead differently,As more women move into high offices | they often bring a style and approach that is distinct from men. But do they make better leaders?Democratic women of the US Senate stand on stage during the final night of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia (top). There are 20 women in the Senate – 14 Democrats and six Republicans.Kelly Ayotte and Joni Ernst take the floor | two dynamic young US senators before a town hall of older military veterans. Between them | they represent a raft of firsts: Senator Ayotte is New Hampshire’s first female attorney general and first female Republican senator. Senator Ernst is Iowa’s first woman ever elected to either house of Congress and the first female military veteran to serve in the Senate.The gender dimension does not go unnoticed. Please welcome “our beautiful senators |” says the veteran who introduces them. Ayotte mentions Ernst’s military service – she’s also a war veteran. But in most ways | the woman thing doesn’t matter. This is just like any other political town hall in campaign season – one senator trying to help another who’s locked in a tight reelection race.Yet the stakes are high. Republican control of the US Senate could hinge on Ayotte’s ability to fend off her Democratic challenger | Gov. Maggie Hassan. And across the country | women figure prominently in the Democrats’ strategy to retake the Senate | nominating women in six of the 11 competitive races.Then there’s Hillary Clinton | the first woman to win a major party’s presidential nomination in the United States.It’s enough to call 2016 Year of the Woman 2.0 | following the original | 1992 | when female representation in the Senate jumped from two to six. Today | female senators number 20 out of 100 | with potential to reach 24 | depending on how the political winds are blowing by Election Day.Gender diversity among major world powers is also rising | with the ascension of Theresa May to the British prime ministership. If Mrs. Clinton wins in November | three of the world’s top five economies will be headed by women. (German Chancellor Angela Merkel is the other.)But the numbers and the “firsts” invite a deeper question: Do women really lead differently? From the halls of government to corporate boardrooms | it’s a burning question.“I think we’re good listeners | and I think that helps |” says Ayotte in an interview. “I don’t want to say my male colleagues aren’t | because plenty of them are. But I think that we listen | and so we’re picking up on where we see the common ground with other people.”On that point | there is bipartisan agreement.“There is good research that shows women tend to have different leadership styles |” Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen | New Hampshire’s other senator | says in an interview. “We tend to be more inclusive | we’re less autocratic in our decisionmaking. We like consensus | we like to get people around the table | and so I think that has made a difference.”Of course | there’s also the example of Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D) of California | the first woman speaker of the House (2007-11). During her tenure | she was known for her ability to wield power – and in a highly partisan way. More than with previous speakers | major legislation came out of her office | not the committees. She was (and is) a master fundraiser for Democrats writ large | a skill she has used to great effect in keeping her members in line.And as a Roman Catholic woman | Congresswoman Pelosi demonstrated at a crucial moment the power of networking. In 2010 | when House passage of the Affordable Care Act appeared in doubt over the abortion issue | she tapped connections her male colleagues had never heard of – two associations of nuns | whose support for the bill proved pivotal.The research on women’s leadership style has been extensive – and mixed. One academic study | released in 2013 | found that women are more attracted to cooperation than men. The reason is that men tend to have greater confidence in their abilities | while women tend to be more optimistic about their prospective teammates’ abilities | according to the study by Peter Kuhn and Marie-Claire Villeval.New research | released in August | looked specifically at gender differences in the US House of Representatives and found “little evidence to suggest women are inherently more cooperative or bipartisan.” The only difference came with Republican women | who tend to recruit more cosponsors on legislation | including more from the opposite party. That tendency was most pronounced on so-called women’s issues | such as education and social welfare.“We interpret these results as evidence that cooperation is mostly driven by a commonality of interest | rather than gender per se |” write the authors | Stefano Gagliarducci and M. Daniele Paserman.The study examined 20 years of data ending in 2008. Since then | female representation in Congress has ticked up a notch | reaching 20 percent in the Senate and nearly that in the House – the rough threshold for a perceived “critical mass” of representation in which women can show perceptible influence.Indeed | since 2013 | female legislators point to multiple examples of how the women of the Senate | in particular | have been instrumental in breaking through congressional gridlock. The best-known example is the end of the 2013 government shutdown | when women senators from both parties met privately over dinner and fashioned a compromise that would form the nucleus of the final deal.More recently | the women of the Senate – all 20 of them | dubbed “the sisterhood” – backed landmark legislation aimed at combating sex trafficking | which President Obama signed into law in May 2015.When asked for other examples | Senator Shaheen cites the 2013 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. “It was considered dead |” she says | “and because all the women [senators] got on board and pushed it | we were able to get it through.”Shaheen also notes the growing number of women who serve in top spots on committees | such as the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee | with Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R) of Alaska as chair and Sen. Maria Cantwell (D) of Washington as the ranking member. “It looks like we may get an energy bill done this year | and I think that speaks to their ability to work together | and to be flexible | and move our colleagues in the House |” Shaheen says.Behind all this female power are the women senators’ regular dinners | a chance to kick back and talk about whatever – their lives | their work | their male colleagues.“We go by Mikulski’s rules – that what happens in those dinners stays in those dinners |” says Shaheen | referring to Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D) of Maryland | the longest-serving woman in congressional history | who is about to retire. “But yeah | they’ve proved to be a great opportunity to build relationships.”As it happens | Shaheen had hosted 12 of her female colleagues the night before at her office. On the menu: lobsters and clam chowder. That much she will reveal. Sen. Susan Collins (R) of Maine was there | Shaheen says | “and we had a back and forth about whether the lobsters came from Maine or New Hampshire.”In 2013 | after the Senate’s 20 women helped end the government shutdown | Sen. John McCain (R) of Arizona wondered out loud: “Imagine what they could do if there were 50 of them.”That may sound logical | but the reality isn’t so simple. While women do bring a distinctive perspective to policy | based on their life experiences | that doesn’t necessarily make them less partisan | experts say. Some of the most polarizing issues are so-called women’s issues | including health care | abortion | and equal pay.“As long as women’s issues constitute a prominent division between the parties | there will be little bipartisan collaboration among women on these policies |” Michele Swers | a political scientist at Georgetown University | wrote in The Washington Post in 2014.Ms. Swers also notes that partisan sorting has made the South – a region less hospitable to women candidates – the stronghold of the Republican Party | while the more moderate brand of Republicanism that predominates in parts of the country more willing to elect women has declined.And because women tend to occupy the “leftward wing” of their respective parties | Democratic women in particular are less inclined to compromise | the Gagliarducci-Paserman study found.Still | none of this means women shouldn’t be more rigorously recruited for public office | say leaders of both parties.“What you need is more good people | and the process of excluding women has excluded good people from service |” says former Gov. John Sununu (R) of New Hampshire. “So what you need to do is level the playing field.”In the business world | boosting female representation on corporate boards – now near 20 percent – has been a long-held goal. Advocates cite benefits to the bottom line. In a famous study | Catalyst Inc. | a nonprofit that promotes women leaders in the workplace | found that corporate boards with the highest female representation attained “significantly higher financial performance” than those with the lowest representation.But whether in the private sector or in government | women as top executives are even rarer than women legislators. Only six of the nation’s 50 governors are women | three Republicans and three Democrats. Among world leaders | fewer than two dozen are female. Among Fortune 500 companies | only 21 chief executive officers – or 4.2 percent – are women.While legislating is an inherently collaborative process | and therefore seems to play to women’s strength | executive roles hew more toward public expectations of how men should behave | i.e. | authoritatively.“I think the more people see women in executive positions | the more they will see that as a normal course of business | and it’s taken longer for that not just in politics but in the boardroom |” says Shaheen.But that becomes a Catch-22: Women don’t step up because they don’t see other women in those positions. “Some would call it a confidence gap |” says Liz Shuler | the No. 2 leader at the AFL-CIO. “We need to do more to increase the leadership skills-building opportunities | so that it becomes second nature for women to step up.” (See interview with Ms. Shuler here.)But do women executives really lead differently from men? Clinton echoes other women leaders on this point: “I just think women in general are better listeners | are more collegial | more open to new ideas and how to make things work in a way that looks for a win-win outcome |” she told Time magazine in January.Meta-analyses have found that women leaders | on average | are “more likely to be democratic | collaborative | and participative” than their male counterparts | who are more likely to be “autocratic and directive” in their approach | writes Alice H. Eagly at TheConversation.com.Of course | there are exceptions. Margaret Thatcher of Britain and Golda Meir of Israel were both known for being tough and assertive. Today | Apple CEO Tim Cook is known for his team-oriented style. But for women aspiring to leadership posts | the challenge is to overcome societal expectations for how women are “supposed to” act – i.e. | nice and nonconfrontational – while still projecting authority. Clinton has faced this “double bind” in both of her presidential campaigns.New Hampshire has a strong record of female leadership. The governor | both US senators | and one of the state’s two House members are women. The chief justice of the state Supreme Court is a woman. The chair of the state GOP is a woman.In 2008 | Granite Staters made history by electing the nation’s first majority-female state legislative body | in the state Senate. In 2013 | the state made history again by sending an all-female congressional delegation to Washington. That could happen again in January.What is it about New Hampshire that breeds women leaders? Start with a culture of independent-mindedness | and an enormous “citizens legislature” – 400 in the House | 24 in the Senate – in a state with only 1.3 million people. Members are paid just $100 a year | plus mileage. Sooner or later | the joke goes | everybody ends up serving.“We have so much local self-governance | women have the opportunity to try things out | to see how they like public service | and then they discover that they like it and that they’re good at it | and one thing leads to the next |” says Governor Hassan in an interview in the State House.Hassan got her start advocating for her disabled son | which caught the notice of then-Governor Shaheen | who appointed her to a state educational funding commission. That led to regular interactions with state legislators – and an introduction to her next mentor | state Sen. Sylvia Larsen | who encouraged Hassan to run for state Senate. She spent six years there | eventually rising to majority leader | losing reelection | then staging a comeback by winning the governorship.The common denominator for most women in politics | it seems | is mentors. Ask Ayotte | New Hampshire’s junior senator | about Ruth Griffin | and her eyes light up. “I love Ruth Griffin. She’s my mentor!” Ayotte gushes | referring to the nonagenarian grand dame of the New Hampshire Republican Party. (See interview with Mrs. Griffin here.)When Griffin served on the state Executive Council – an elected board that serves as a check on the governor – she advocated strongly for Ayotte | insisting the Democratic governor reappoint the Republican Ayotte as attorney general.Shaheen | now a mentor to others | cites as her inspiration Marilla Ricker | the first woman to run for governor of New Hampshire – before women even had the right to vote. Shaheen also speaks fondly of the late Susan McLane | a Republican state senator “who was always very good to me.” (Ms. McLane’s daughter is Rep. Ann McLane Kuster (D) of New Hampshire.) Shaheen broke two gender barriers in N.H. | first with her election as governor (1996) | then as a US senator (2008).Men | too | have championed women politicians here. At a recent Republican women’s chili fest in Stratham | N.H. | Mr. Sununu recalls fighting to make Vesta Roy the first woman state Senate president | in 1983. “There’s that classic picture of me standing at the state Senate door | cracked open | peeking in to make sure the 13 votes I had lined up for her stayed with her |” Sununu says.Whether New Hampshire’s success at electing women to higher office can be duplicated elsewhere remains an open question. Only two other states have two female US senators | and five others have female governors. New Hampshire is no longer the champ at electing women state legislators; that crown belongs to Colorado | with 42 percent. The top 10 states for female representation in state legislatures are mostly Northern | and the bottom 10 mostly Southern | suggesting cultural factors.Overall | women hold a higher percentage of state legislative seats (24.6 percent) than seats in Congress (19.4 percent | House and Senate combined). At least the female “farm team” has more players than the “major league |” though those numbers still fall far short of matching the overall female population of the country | 50.8 percent.For many women | reaching parity with men in government – and in business | the judiciary | the labor movement | and other spheres of life – is a deeply held goal. But a quick glance at the graphs charting female representation in state and national legislatures reveals a stark truth: Growth has nearly hit a plateau.If progress continues at the current rate of change since 1960 | women will not achieve equal representation in Congress until 2117 | according to the Institute for Women’s Policy Research. Women’s representation in state legislatures | which more than quintupled between 1971 and 2015 | has also essentially plateaued. What’s going on?“It’s not that women are running in droves and losing |” says Debbie Walsh | director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University in New Brunswick | N.J. “We know that when women run | they win at about the same rate as men do.”Women also do just as well in fundraising as men | even if they have to work harder to raise the same amount. Part of the problem | Ms. Walsh says | comes in the recruitment process. Much of the recruiting is done by white men | and they recruit who they know – other white men.That is particularly so among Republicans: Only 17 percent of Republican state lawmakers are women | a rate that hasn’t changed since the early 1990s. In contrast | Democrats doubled their rate of female state representation during the same period from 15 percent to 30 percent.In Congress (both houses) | the disparity is even more stark: Only 9 percent of Republicans are female | versus 33 percent of Democrats. In the Senate alone | only six of the 20 women members are Republican.Walsh cites several factors behind this gap: Republican women are perceived to be more moderate than their male counterparts | and can have a harder time making it out of the primaries | where turnout is low and skews conservative. The GOP also has no counterpart to Emily’s List – a well-funded political action committee that helps pro-abortion-rights Democratic women get elected. And then there’s the simple fact that more women identify as Democrats | so their recruitment pool is bigger.In New Hampshire | where both legislative chambers are controlled by the Republicans | Democratic women legislators still outnumber Republican women legislators | 73 to 49. State GOP chair Jennifer Horn says the party – nationally | not just in New Hampshire – needs a message that’s more inclusive.“I’m being diplomatic – I think there are times when some of the folks in our party are not as sensitive to the fact that men and women see the world differently |” says Ms. Horn. “When we’re talking about jobs and the economy | for example | we need to be cognizant of the fact that women are an economic engine in and of themselves.”And then there’s the fact that | in both parties | women are less likely than men to run for office without being recruited.In the Monitor’s conversations with Ernst and Ayotte | both mentioned how they were asked several times to run for the Senate before saying yes – and both brought up family issues. Without using the word “multitasking |” they both show that they have mastered that classic skill of the working mom.“It’s about getting the message out about empowering women and saying | you can do this |” says Ernst. “It is important that you have a supportive family | even more so for women. I have a teenage daughter right now – we’re looking at colleges – and sometimes it’s hard for a woman to be away. But there are ways of making it work.”Before running for Senate | Ayotte had been asked a couple of times to run for Congress | but declined – in part | she says | because she was pregnant | but also because she had plans in her work as a prosecutor.Ayotte then excuses herself. “I’ve got to pick up my daughter before 5:30 or I’m in trouble!”,REAL,,,How women lead differently As more women move into high offices | they often bring a style and approach that is distinct from men. But do they make better leaders?Democratic women of the US Senate stand on stage during the final night of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia (top).

She was (and is) a master fundraiser for Democrats writ large | a skill she has used to great effect in keeping her members in line.And as a Roman Catholic woman | Congresswoman Pelosi demonstrated at a crucial moment the power of networking. In 2010 | when House passage of the Affordable Care Act appeared in doubt over the abortion issue | she tapped connections her male colleagues had never heard of – two associations of nuns | whose support for the bill proved pivotal.The research on women’s leadership style has been extensive – and mixed. One academic study | released in 2013 | found that women are more attracted to cooperation than men. The reason is that men tend to have greater confidence in their abilities | while women tend to be more optimistic about their prospective teammates’ abilities | according to the study by Peter Kuhn and Marie-Claire Villeval.New research | released in August | looked specifically at gender differences in the US House of Representatives and found “little evidence to suggest women are inherently more cooperative or bipartisan.” The only difference came with Republican women | who tend to recruit more cosponsors on legislation | including more from the opposite party. That tendency was most pronounced on so-called women’s issues | such as education and social welfare.“We interpret these results as evidence that cooperation is mostly driven by a commonality of interest | rather than gender per se |” write the authors | Stefano Gagliarducci and M. Daniele Paserman.The study examined 20 years of data ending in 2008. Since then | female representation in Congress has ticked up a notch | reaching 20 percent in the Senate and nearly that in the House – the rough threshold for a perceived “critical mass” of representation in which women can show perceptible influence.Indeed | since 2013 | female legislators point to multiple examples of how the women of the Senate | in particular | have been instrumental in breaking through congressional gridlock. The best-known example is the end of the 2013 government shutdown | when women senators from both parties met privately over dinner and fashioned a compromise that would form the nucleus of the final deal.More recently | the women of the Senate – all 20 of them | dubbed “the sisterhood” – backed landmark legislation aimed at combating sex trafficking | which President Obama signed into law in May 2015.When asked for other examples | Senator Shaheen cites the 2013 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. “It was considered dead |” she says | “and because all the women [senators] got on board and pushed it | we were able to get it through.”Shaheen also notes the growing number of women who serve in top spots on committees | such as the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee | with Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R) of Alaska as chair and Sen. Maria Cantwell (D) of Washington as the ranking member. “It looks like we may get an energy bill done this year | and I think that speaks to their ability to work together | and to be flexible | and move our colleagues in the House |” Shaheen says.Behind all this female power are the women senators’ regular dinners | a chance to kick back and talk about whatever – their lives | their work | their male colleagues.“We go by Mikulski’s rules – that what happens in those dinners stays in those dinners |” says Shaheen | referring to Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D) of Maryland | the longest-serving woman in congressional history | who is about to retire. “But yeah | they’ve proved to be a great opportunity to build relationships.”As it happens | Shaheen had hosted 12 of her female colleagues the night before at her office. On the menu: lobsters and clam chowder. That much she will reveal. Sen. Susan Collins (R) of Maine was there | Shaheen says | “and we had a back and forth about whether the lobsters came from Maine or New Hampshire.”In 2013 | after the Senate’s 20 women helped end the government shutdown | Sen. John McCain (R) of Arizona wondered out loud: “Imagine what they could do if there were 50 of them.”That may sound logical | but the reality isn’t so simple. While women do bring a distinctive perspective to policy | based on their life experiences | that doesn’t necessarily make them less partisan | experts say. Some of the most polarizing issues are so-called women’s issues | including health care | abortion | and equal pay.“As long as women’s issues constitute a prominent division between the parties | there will be little bipartisan collaboration among women on these policies |” Michele Swers | a political scientist at Georgetown University | wrote in The Washington Post in 2014.Ms. Swers also notes that partisan sorting has made the South – a region less hospitable to women candidates – the stronghold of the Republican Party | while the more moderate brand of Republicanism that predominates in parts of the country more willing to elect women has declined.And because women tend to occupy the “leftward wing” of their respective parties | Democratic women in particular are less inclined to compromise | the Gagliarducci-Paserman study found.Still | none of this means women shouldn’t be more rigorously recruited for public office | say leaders of both parties.“What you need is more good people | and the process of excluding women has excluded good people from service |” says former Gov. John Sununu (R) of New Hampshire. “So what you need to do is level the playing field.”In the business world | boosting female representation on corporate boards – now near 20 percent – has been a long-held goal. Advocates cite benefits to the bottom line. In a famous study | Catalyst Inc. | a nonprofit that promotes women leaders in the workplace | found that corporate boards with the highest female representation attained “significantly higher financial performance” than those with the lowest representation.But whether in the private sector or in government | women as top executives are even rarer than women legislators. Only six of the nation’s 50 governors are women | three Republicans and three Democrats. Among world leaders | fewer than two dozen are female. Among Fortune 500 companies | only 21 chief executive officers – or 4.2 percent – are women.While legislating is an inherently collaborative process | and therefore seems to play to women’s strength | executive roles hew more toward public expectations of how men should behave | i.e. | authoritatively.“I think the more people see women in executive positions | the more they will see that as a normal course of business | and it’s taken longer for that not just in politics but in the boardroom |” says Shaheen.But that becomes a Catch-22: Women don’t step up because they don’t see other women in those positions. “Some would call it a confidence gap |” says Liz Shuler | the No. 2 leader at the AFL-CIO. “We need to do more to increase the leadership skills-building opportunities | so that it becomes second nature for women to step up.” (See interview with Ms. Shuler here.)But do women executives really lead differently from men? Clinton echoes other women leaders on this point: “I just think women in general are better listeners | are more collegial | more open to new ideas and how to make things work in a way that looks for a win-win outcome |” she told Time magazine in January.Meta-analyses have found that women leaders | on average | are “more likely to be democratic | collaborative | and participative” than their male counterparts | who are more likely to be “autocratic and directive” in their approach | writes Alice H. Eagly at TheConversation.com.Of course | there are exceptions. Margaret Thatcher of Britain and Golda Meir of Israel were both known for being tough and assertive. Today | Apple CEO Tim Cook is known for his team-oriented style. But for women aspiring to leadership posts | the challenge is to overcome societal expectations for how women are “supposed to” act – i.e. | nice and nonconfrontational – while still projecting authority. Clinton has faced this “double bind” in both of her presidential campaigns.New Hampshire has a strong record of female leadership. The governor | both US senators | and one of the state’s two House members are women. The chief justice of the state Supreme Court is a woman. The chair of the state GOP is a woman.In 2008 | Granite Staters made history by electing the nation’s first majority-female state legislative body | in the state Senate. In 2013 | the state made history again by sending an all-female congressional delegation to Washington. That could happen again in January.What is it about New Hampshire that breeds women leaders? Start with a culture of independent-mindedness | and an enormous “citizens legislature” – 400 in the House | 24 in the Senate – in a state with only 1.3 million people. Members are paid just $100 a year | plus mileage. Sooner or later | the joke goes | everybody ends up serving.“We have so much local self-governance | women have the opportunity to try things out | to see how they like public service | and then they discover that they like it and that they’re good at it | and one thing leads to the next |” says Governor Hassan in an interview in the State House.Hassan got her start advocating for her disabled son | which caught the notice of then-Governor Shaheen | who appointed her to a state educational funding commission. That led to regular interactions with state legislators – and an introduction to her next mentor | state Sen. Sylvia Larsen | who encouraged Hassan to run for state Senate. She spent six years there | eventually rising to majority leader | losing reelection | then staging a comeback by winning the governorship.The common denominator for most women in politics | it seems | is mentors. Ask Ayotte | New Hampshire’s junior senator | about Ruth Griffin | and her eyes light up. “I love Ruth Griffin. She’s my mentor!” Ayotte gushes | referring to the nonagenarian grand dame of the New Hampshire Republican Party. (See interview with Mrs. Griffin here.)When Griffin served on the state Executive Council – an elected board that serves as a check on the governor – she advocated strongly for Ayotte | insisting the Democratic governor reappoint the Republican Ayotte as attorney general.Shaheen | now a mentor to others | cites as her inspiration Marilla Ricker | the first woman to run for governor of New Hampshire – before women even had the right to vote. Shaheen also speaks fondly of the late Susan McLane | a Republican state senator “who was always very good to me.” (Ms. McLane’s daughter is Rep. Ann McLane Kuster (D) of New Hampshire.) Shaheen broke two gender barriers in N.H. | first with her election as governor (1996) | then as a US senator (2008).Men | too | have championed women politicians here. At a recent Republican women’s chili fest in Stratham | N.H. | Mr. Sununu recalls fighting to make Vesta Roy the first woman state Senate president | in 1983. “There’s that classic picture of me standing at the state Senate door | cracked open | peeking in to make sure the 13 votes I had lined up for her stayed with her |” Sununu says.Whether New Hampshire’s success at electing women to higher office can be duplicated elsewhere remains an open question. Only two other states have two female US senators | and five others have female governors. New Hampshire is no longer the champ at electing women state legislators; that crown belongs to Colorado | with 42 percent. The top 10 states for female representation in state legislatures are mostly Northern | and the bottom 10 mostly Southern | suggesting cultural factors.Overall | women hold a higher percentage of state legislative seats (24.6 percent) than seats in Congress (19.4 percent | House and Senate combined). At least the female “farm team” has more players than the “major league |” though those numbers still fall far short of matching the overall female population of the country | 50.8 percent.For many women | reaching parity with men in government – and in business | the judiciary | the labor movement | and other spheres of life – is a deeply held goal. But a quick glance at the graphs charting female representation in state and national legislatures reveals a stark truth: Growth has nearly hit a plateau.If progress continues at the current rate of change since 1960 | women will not achieve equal representation in Congress until 2117 | according to the Institute for Women’s Policy Research. Women’s representation in state legislatures | which more than quintupled between 1971 and 2015 | has also essentially plateaued. What’s going on?“It’s not that women are running in droves and losing |” says Debbie Walsh | director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University in New Brunswick | N.J. “We know that when women run | they win at about the same rate as men do.”Women also do just as well in fundraising as men | even if they have to work harder to raise the same amount. Part of the problem | Ms. Walsh says | comes in the recruitment process. Much of the recruiting is done by white men | and they recruit who they know – other white men.That is particularly so among Republicans: Only 17 percent of Republican state lawmakers are women | a rate that hasn’t changed since the early 1990s. In contrast | Democrats doubled their rate of female state representation during the same period from 15 percent to 30 percent.In Congress (both houses) | the disparity is even more stark: Only 9 percent of Republicans are female | versus 33 percent of Democrats. In the Senate alone | only six of the 20 women members are Republican.Walsh cites several factors behind this gap: Republican women are perceived to be more moderate than their male counterparts | and can have a harder time making it out of the primaries | where turnout is low and skews conservative. The GOP also has no counterpart to Emily’s List – a well-funded political action committee that helps pro-abortion-rights Democratic women get elected. And then there’s the simple fact that more women identify as Democrats | so their recruitment pool is bigger.In New Hampshire | where both legislative chambers are controlled by the Republicans | Democratic women legislators still outnumber Republican women legislators | 73 to 49. State GOP chair Jennifer Horn says the party – nationally | not just in New Hampshire – needs a message that’s more inclusive.“I’m being diplomatic – I think there are times when some of the folks in our party are not as sensitive to the fact that men and women see the world differently |” says Ms. Horn. “When we’re talking about jobs and the economy | for example | we need to be cognizant of the fact that women are an economic engine in and of themselves.”And then there’s the fact that | in both parties | women are less likely than men to run for office without being recruited.In the Monitor’s conversations with Ernst and Ayotte | both mentioned how they were asked several times to run for the Senate before saying yes – and both brought up family issues. Without using the word “multitasking |” they both show that they have mastered that classic skill of the working mom.“It’s about getting the message out about empowering women and saying | you can do this |” says Ernst. “It is important that you have a supportive family | even more so for women. I have a teenage daughter right now – we’re looking at colleges – and sometimes it’s hard for a woman to be away. But there are ways of making it work.”Before running for Senate | Ayotte had been asked a couple of times to run for Congress | but declined – in part | she says | because she was pregnant | but also because she had plans in her work as a prosecutor.Ayotte then excuses herself. “I’ve got to pick up my daughter before 5:30 or I’m in trouble!”,woman lead differently woman move high office  they

3304,What's in that Iran bill that Obama doesn't like?,"Washington (CNN) For months | the White House and Congress have wrangled over a bill that would give lawmakers a greater say in the Iran nuclear deal the administration is hammering out along with other world powers.And now | less than two weeks after a framework agreement with Tehran was reached | the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is planning to take up the measure.On Tuesday | the committee will consider amendments to Tennessee Republican Sen. Bob Corker's Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act before deciding whether to have the full Senate vote on it.For many in Congress | it's a very simple premise: Congress should weigh in on the terms of a final nuclear deal with Iran.But for the White House | and some Democrats in Congress | that's an explosive idea that could derail the talks — and therefore must be stopped.So what's in the bill?Supporters of the legislation have emphasized that it would allow Congress to give a thumbs up or down on the deal President Barack Obama is aiming to finalize with Iran by the negotiations' June 30 deadline. Backers think that's only fair since the United States is contemplating a major nuclear pact with a decadeslong enemy.The bill would give Congress a chance to hold hearings | host briefings and pave the way to a vote on a joint resolution that could express approval or disapproval of the deal. It also requires the Obama administration to quickly report to Congress on details of the deal and regularly assess whether Iran is keeping its commitments. And it spells out what the President needs to do vis-a-vis Congress if Iran is found violating the terms.But most important | it would keep Obama from waiving any congressional sanctions on Iran during Congress' 60-day review period. And if Congress passes a joint resolution of disapproval | then sanctions could not be lifted even after that time.Does this hurt the diplomatic effort to reach a final deal?Iran's primary reason for agreeing to the deal's limits on its nuclear program is to get sanctions relief.Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani have insisted sanctions must be lifted on Day One of the deal.

But so far that effort hasn't succeeded | as the White House remains opposed.",REAL,,,"What's in that Iran bill that Obama doesn't like? Washington (CNN) For months | the White House and Congress have wrangled over a bill that would give lawmakers a greater say in the Iran nuclear deal the administration is hammering out along with other world powers.And now | less than two weeks after a framework agreement with Tehran was reached | the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is planning to take up the measure.On Tuesday | the committee will consider amendments to Tennessee Republican Sen. Bob Corker's Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act before deciding whether to have the full Senate vote on it.For many in Congress | it's a very simple premise: Congress should weigh in on the terms of a final nuclear deal with Iran.But for the White House | and some Democrats in Congress | that's an explosive idea that could derail the talks — and therefore must be stopped.So what's in the bill?Supporters of the legislation have emphasized that it would allow Congress to give a thumbs up or down on the deal President Barack Obama is aiming to finalize with Iran by the negotiations' June 30 deadline. Backers think that's only fair since the United States is contemplating a major nuclear pact with a decadeslong enemy.The bill would give Congress a chance to hold hearings | host briefings and pave the way to a vote on a joint resolution that could express approval or disapproval of the deal. It also requires the Obama administration to quickly report to Congress on details of the deal and regularly assess whether Iran is keeping its commitments. And it spells out what the President needs to do vis-a-vis Congress if Iran is found violating the terms.But most important | it would keep Obama from waiving any congressional sanctions on Iran during Congress' 60-day review period. And if Congress passes a joint resolution of disapproval | then sanctions could not be lifted even after that time.Does this hurt the diplomatic effort to reach a final deal?Iran's primary reason for agreeing to the deal's limits on its nuclear program is to get sanctions relief.Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani have insisted sanctions must be lifted on Day One of the deal. While the Obama administration has said it would wait several months before lifting sanctions -- to verify that Iran has taken major steps to roll back its program — the President is counting on having some latitude to waive sanctions in order to give Iran an incentive to sign the deal and then keep its commitments.The Corker bill makes it less likely sanctions would be lifted | and lifted in a timely way | which gives less encouragement to Iran.Without the bill | could Obama lift all sanctions on Iran?Not all | but most — at least for a limited time.Without the Corker-Menendez bill (named after Corker and lead Democratic co-sponsor Sen.

Those enacted through the United Nations and by presidential executive order could be fully removed | and most of those passed by Congress could be waived by Obama until he leaves office | when they would go back into effect unless the next president continues to waive them.If the Corker-Menendez bill becomes law and a deal is finalized | Obama wouldn't be able to lift the congressional sanctions for at least 60 days.During that 60-day review phase | the bill says Obama can't ""waive | suspend | reduce | provide relief from | or otherwise limit the application of statutory sanctions.""How can Obama waive sanctions passed by Congress anyway?The biggest sanctions package approved by Congress | widely credited with crippling Iran's economy and bringing the country to the negotiating table | was the 2010 Comprehensive Iran Sanctions | Accountability | and Divestment Act.It included a provision that gives the President leverage to waive sanctions for a limited time if he determines it's in the U.S. national security interest.He wouldn't be able to permanently sunset the sanctions | though | unless Iran cuts its ties with and stops funding terror organizations around the world | an aspect not being addressed in the current negotiations with Iran and not predicted to happen any time soon.The administration says sanctions are where Congress could eventually weigh in on the Iran deal -- by repealing them -- but that would only happen if lawmakers deem the deal a good one.How would Congress weigh in during the 60-day review period?Congress could pass a joint resolution approving of the deal or disapproving of the deal and forbidding any sanctions relief.

2517,The slippery slope to Trump’s proposed ban on Muslims,With little fanfare this fall | the New York developer who had planned to build an Islamic community center north of the World Trade Center announced that he would instead use the site for a 70-story tower of luxury condos.Those who had rallied in opposition to the building because of its religious affiliation back in 2010 were exultant. “The importance of the defeat of the Ground Zero Mosque cannot be overstated |” Pamela Geller | president of the American Freedom Defense Initiative | wrote on the website Breitbart in September. “The Ground Zero Mosque became a watershed issue in our effort to raise awareness of and ultimately halt and roll back the advance of Islamic law and Islamic supremacism in America.”It’s all well and good that so many Republicans have condemned Donald Trump’s reprehensible call for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) was particularly forceful | calling proper attention to the “many Muslims serving in our armed forces | dying for this country.”When he was president | George W. Bush honorably put a lid on right-wing Islamophobia. He regularly praised American Muslims and stressed that the United States needed Muslim allies to fight violent extremism. Once Bush was gone | restraint on his side of politics fell away.Thus | Trump’s embrace of a religious test for entry to our country did not come out of nowhere. On the contrary | it simply brought us to the bottom of a slippery slope created by the ongoing exploitation of anti-Muslim feeling for political purposes.You don’t have to reach far back in time to see why Trump figured he had the ideological space for his Muslim ban. Last month | it was Jeb Bush who introduced the idea of linking the rights of Syrian refugees to their religion. He said he was comfortable granting admission to “people like orphans and people who are clearly not going to be terrorists. Or Christians.” Asked how he’d determine who was Christian | he explained that “you can prove you’re a Christian.”Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) took a similar view | saying  | “There is no meaningful risk of Christians committing acts of terror.”Trump took limits on Muslim access to our country to their logical — if un-American and odious — conclusion. Vice President Biden said that Trump was serving up “a very | very dangerous brew |” but the brew has been steeping for a long time. This is why the “Ground Zero Mosque” episode is so instructive.The demagoguery began with the labeling of the controversy itself. As PolitiFact pointed out | “the proposed mosque is not at or on Ground Zero. It does not directly abut it or overlook it.” It was “two long blocks” away. And while a mosque was part of the proposed cultural center | the plans also included “a swimming pool | gym and basketball court | a 500-seat auditorium | a restaurant and culinary school | a library and art studios.”This didn’t stop opponents from going over the top | and Newt Gingrich deserved some kind of award for the most incendiary comment of all. “Nazis |” he said | “don’t have the right to put up a sign next to the Holocaust museum in Washington.”When President Obama defended the right of developers to build the project | he was — surprise | surprise — accused of being out of touch | and Republicans were happy to make the Muslim center and Obama’s defense of religious rights an issue in the 2010 campaign.“I think it does speak to the lack of connection between the administration and Washington and folks inside the Beltway and mainstream America |” said Sen. John Cornyn (Tex.) | who was then chairman of the committee in charge of electing Republicans to the Senate. Voters | he said | felt they were “being lectured to | not listened to.” Sound familiar?At the time | John Feehery | the veteran Republican strategist | put his finger on why Republicans were so eager to lambaste Obama’s response to the Ground Zero issue. “This will help drive turnout for the GOP base |” he said.The Republican establishment is now all upset with Trump | but he is simply the revenge of a Republican base that took its leaders’ pandering — on Islam and a host of other issues — seriously.You can’t be “just a little” intolerant of Muslims | any more than you can be “just a little” prejudiced against Catholics or Jews.

778,Hillary Clinton Makes A Bipartisan Appeal on Staten Island,Hillary Clinton told a Staten Island crowd today that she was the candidate who could reach across party lines to get things done as president—pointing to her experience representing the borough in the Senate and even giving public thanks to Republican President George W. Bush.“I have no time for people who are partisan for the sake of being partisan |” Ms. Clinton | a Democrat and former secretary of state | told a crowd that welcomed her enthusiastically in a historic building at Snug Harbor Cultural Center.Ms. Clinton was the second leading presidential candidate to speak on Staten Island today | after Republican Donald Trump delivered a typical stump speech at a Republican brunch. But Ms. Clinton | perhaps sensing or recalling Staten Island’s ever-present desire for politicians to pay attention to the forgotten borough | delivered a speech that seemed to be especially tailored for the borough | which is more conservative than the rest of New York City. The majority of its voters are registered Democrats | but the borough routinely swings Republican.“When I ran in 2000 | I didn’t carry Staten Island. When I ran in 2006 | I did |” Ms. Clinton said today. “I’ve got no problem with people having political disagreements. That’s in America’s DNA | isn’t it?”Instead | Ms. Clinton decried “deliberate efforts to set Americans against each other.” She harkened back to representing the borough of cops and firefighters on September 11 | 20001 | when nearly 300 Staten Islanders were killed in the terror attacks. She noted the city’s mayor | the state’s governor | and the president were all Republicans.“I did not for one minute stop and say to myself: ‘Well | I don’t know | can we work together?'” Ms. Clinton said. “How absurd is that?”Ms. Clinton said with 3 |000 people murdered | people “pulled together” and “politics was totally left behind.” She had criticized President Bush for his handling of a strong economy he “inherited” from her husband | President Bill Clinton | and for other reasons. But she praised him for approving billions of dollars to rebuild lower Manhattan after the terror attacks | even as others in Washington didn’t want to spend it.“I publicly say | ‘Thank you President George W. Bush |’ for making sure that we got the money that we needed to rebuild our city |” Ms. Clinton said.She also touted her record working for the borough after the attacks | including sounding the alarm on air quality and pushing for the passage of the Zadroga Act. Ms. Clinton went on to discuss her foreign policy experience | saying anyone who wants to president has to be able to offer specifics on what they would do—an allusion to her Democratic rival Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders—but also has to be able to keep people safe.“Maybe we take that more seriously here in New York | but we should |” she said. “And we are going to do everything we can to keep America safe.”She cited her work building a coalition that “brought Iran to the negotiating table |” without mentioning how controversial that final Iran deal was for President Barack Obama.Ms. Clinton’s rally had little in common with Mr. Trump’s Staten Island event | except one thing: the crowd at both seemed to hate Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Ms. Clinton mentioned his plan to spy on Muslim neighborhoods | which has also been dismissed by Police Commissioner Bill Bratton.At the mention of Mr. Cruz’s name | the crowd offered a chorus of boos.The crowd had been hyped up for Ms. Clinton before she even arrived | and gave a nice response to several local pols as they urged people to get out the vote on Tuesday.“Hillary is the only one with the experience |” said Councilwoman Debi Rose | a Democrat who represents the borough’s North Shore. “She knows what it’s like to be in the White House. She knows the realities. She knows that living and running the White House in this country is not a reality show.”Ms. Clinton | at the end of her speech | offered the kind of promise Staten Island always loves—and the kind it holds politicians to | if the way the Staten Island Advance repeatedly agitated and inquired about a town hall Mayor Bill de Blasio will finally hold here on Wednesday night is any indication.“I want you to hold me accountable |” Ms. Clinton said. “I will be coming back to Staten Island when I am your president.”,REAL,,,Hillary Clinton Makes A Bipartisan Appeal on Staten Island Hillary Clinton told a Staten Island crowd today that she was the candidate who could reach across party lines to get things done as president—pointing to her experience representing the borough in the Senate and even giving public thanks to Republican President George W. Bush.“I have no time for people who are partisan for the sake of being partisan |” Ms. Clinton | a Democrat and former secretary of state | told a crowd that welcomed her enthusiastically in a historic building at Snug Harbor Cultural Center.Ms. Clinton was the second leading presidential candidate to speak on Staten Island today | after Republican Donald Trump delivered a typical stump speech at a Republican brunch. But Ms. Clinton | perhaps sensing or recalling Staten Island’s ever-present desire for politicians to pay attention to the forgotten borough | delivered a speech that seemed to be especially tailored for the borough | which is more conservative than the rest of New York City. The majority of its voters are registered Democrats | but the borough routinely swings Republican.“When I ran in 2000 | I didn’t carry Staten Island. When I ran in 2006 | I did |” Ms. Clinton said today. “I’ve got no problem with people having political disagreements. That’s in America’s DNA | isn’t it?”Instead | Ms. Clinton decried “deliberate efforts to set Americans against each other.” She harkened back to representing the borough of cops and firefighters on September 11 | 20001 | when nearly 300 Staten Islanders were killed in the terror attacks.

3300,New Senate majority leader’s main goal for GOP: Don’t be scary,Mitch McConnell has an unusual admonition for the new Republican majority as it takes over the Senate this week: Don’t be “scary.”The incoming Senate majority leader has set a political goal for the next two years of overseeing a functioning | reasonable majority on Capitol Hill that scores some measured conservative wins | particularly against environmental regulations | but probably not big victories such as a full repeal of the health-care law. McConnell’s priority is to set the stage for a potential GOP presidential victory in 2016.“I don’t want the American people to think that if they add a Republican president to a Republican Congress | that’s going to be a scary outcome. I want the American people to be comfortable with the fact that the Republican House and Senate is a responsible | right-of-center | governing majority |” the Kentucky Republican said in a broad interview just before Christmas in his Capitol office.It’s a far cry from his defiant declaration in 2010 that his “single most important” goal was to make President Obama a one-term president | an antagonizing oath that Democrats frequently invoke to embarrass the GOP leader — Obama won reelection comfortably in 2012 | and McConnell’s party lost seats.Now in charge at both ends of the Capitol | Republicans aim to avoid the worst excesses of the past four years and make sure the public isn’t fearful of the GOP’s course.“There would be nothing frightening about adding a Republican president to that governing majority |” McConnell said | explaining how he wants voters to view the party on the eve of the 2016 election. “I think that’s the single best thing we can do | is to not mess up the playing field | if you will | for whoever the nominee ultimately is.”But McConnell | who will become majority leader Tuesday | is not planning to avoid conflict altogether. He wants to use the annual spending bills to compel Obama to accept conservative policy riders that will divide Democrats | similar to the December spending bill’s inclusion of a provision benefiting Wall Street firms involved in risky derivative trades. That rider brought a liberal outcry but did not end up torpedoing the bill | which had Obama’s support.McConnell has been coaching his members to understand that | in the initial rounds | they will have to almost unanimously support the budget outline and the spending bills | because few Democrats will support their policy riders.With 54 Republicans in his caucus | McConnell knows that he’s a long way from getting 67 votes to override an Obama veto and that it won’t even be easy getting six Democrats to regularly support legislation so that he can overcome likely filibusters led by the incoming minority leader | Sen. Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.). Still | on some issues | such as energy and taxes on the health industry | McConnell thinks there’s enough bipartisan support to get bills onto Obama’s desk.“They’d like to be relevant. They’d like to be part of the process |” he said of discussions with some rank-and-file Democrats. “Assuming we will have on most issues a largely unified conference — I don’t expect that on everything — it wouldn’t take a whole lot of Democrats to actually pass legislation in the Senate.”But McConnell said those who are “craving some grand deal as a way to measure the next two years” should lower their expectations. He’s very skeptical of such bargains with Democrats on tough issues such as immigration and entitlement reform. Instead | he believes three issues have potential common ground: international trade deals | an overhaul of the tax code and new revenue streams for infrastructure projects.“Could the country use a lot more? You bet. But there’s no way you can overcome a reluctant president on something really large |” McConnell said. The best he can do on some of those bigger issues is force Obama to break out his veto pen so there is a clear set of Democratic policy stances Republicans can campaign against in 2016.Democrats are dubious of McConnell’s pledge to avert edge-of-the-cliff moments. They believe he will run into the same problems that have bedeviled House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) during the past four years — including the inability to corral rabble-rousers such as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) to support an agenda that conservative critics will probably view as not bold enough in challenging Obama. Appeasing those far-right conservatives will lead to an agenda that Democrats hope to exploit in 2016.“What Senator McConnell wants people to think and what they will think when they see the results for themselves are two very different things |” said Reid’s spokesman | Adam Jentleson. “Senator McConnell heads a caucus that is obsessed with rigging the game against working people in favor of wealthy special interests. That’s a scary fact indeed | and he won’t be able to hide it.”While McConnell’s office is adorned with a portrait of Kentucky’s only other Senate majority leader — Alben W. Barkley | whose tenure was often marked by clashes with his own party’s president | Franklin D. Roosevelt — his model more resembles that of George Mitchell | the Democratic majority leader from 1989 through 1994.Without ever shutting down the government | Mitchell stared down a president of the opposite party | George H.W. Bush | and won several liberal victories in a 1990 budget showdown. Mitchell also delivered a slew of legislation to Bush’s desk that drew a veto | helping frame the debate for the 1992 election on domestic policy.McConnell has recently studied other two-term presidents on how often they vetoed legislation in their last two years in office. Obama has issued only two minor vetoes over technical matters | largely because the previously Democratic-run Senate prevented anything from reaching his desk that he opposed.McConnell suggested that a veto strategy would help clarify issues for voters. “I think his bureaucracy across the board has done a lot of damage to the country. . . . I’d at least like for him to have to personally take responsibility for it | even if he in the end decides to veto the bill over some restriction on EPA regulations.”McConnell is keenly aware of the challenges of reining in some of the impulses that his fellow Republican lawmakers have developed over eight straight years in the minority.The first test will come on an energy debate | which could begin by the end of this week. McConnell is trying to keep his side from offering amendments not related to energy issues. In recent years | when some rank-and-file Republicans wanted to stop the Senate in its tracks | they would threaten amendments related to how Congress gets its health care.“I’ve asked my members to restrain themselves |” he said.Restraint has been hard to come by in this political era | particularly because a small army of conservative groups has made it a mission to push Republicans to the most strident stands | even if it means shutting down the government or risking default on the national debt.McConnell faced some of those groups firsthand when they supported his 2014 primary challenger | and he faced a grinding general election against a Democrat who was well financed.It cost nearly $30 million from his campaign war chest and tens of millions of dollars more from outside groups. Winning both races handily | McConnell is delivering a message to Republicans on how to behave heading into 2016.“Don’t try to reinvent yourself. Be yourself | number one. And don’t be afraid of a primary. We will win all the primaries. We did it in ’14. We will do it in ’16 |” McConnell said.Shortly after Election Day this fall | McConnell sat down with Obama for a rare one-on-one meeting in the Oval Office | a huddle that both sides kept largely secret. In the pre-Christmas interview | McConnell acknowledged that the meeting’s purpose was only to discuss areas where the president and Republicans might find bipartisan agreement — because their disagreements on other issues were too in­trac­table.That meeting | he said | focused on trade deals | a tax code overhaul and infrastructure funding. “Can we get there on tax reform | trade | infrastructure?” he said.He eschewed the idea of holding the debt ceiling hostage to gain spending-cut concessions from Obama | a tool Republicans had to use before because they were in the minority.“We are in the majority. We can pass a budget. We can determine how much we’re going to spend |” he said.Avoiding those moments could make for a less “scary” Congress | giving the Republicans a better chance in 2016 to hit the trifecta and gain the White House. His own horse is already chosen | Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) | but don’t expect McConnell to be out on the campaign trail or doing any other favors for his home-state colleague.“I’m going to be supporting Rand Paul. But he knows that beyond that | I won’t be involved in presidential politics. I’ve got a big job here |” he said.,REAL,,,New Senate majority leader’s main goal for GOP: Don’t be scary Mitch McConnell has an unusual admonition for the new Republican majority as it takes over the Senate this week: Don’t be “scary.”The incoming Senate majority leader has set a political goal for the next two years of overseeing a functioning | reasonable majority on Capitol Hill that scores some measured conservative wins | particularly against environmental regulations | but probably not big victories such as a full repeal of the health-care law.

6155,‘Inferno’ and the Overpopulation Myth,Mises.org November 1 | 2016 Inferno is a great thriller | featuring Tom Hanks reprising his role as Professor Robert Langdon. The previous movie adaptations of Dan Brown’s books ( Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code ) were a success | and I expect Inferno will do well in theaters | too. Langdon is a professor of symbology whose puzzle solving skills and knowledge of history come in high demand when a billionaire leaves a trail of clues based on Dante’s Inferno to a biological weapon that would halve the world’s population. The villain | however | has good motives. As a radical Malthusian | he believes that the human race needs halving if it is to survive at all | even if through a plague. Malthus’s name is not mentioned in the movie | but his ideas are certainly there. Inferno provides us an opportunity to unpack this overpopulation fear | and see where it stands today. Thomas Malthus (1766–1834) thought that the potential exponential growth of population was a problem. If the population increases faster than the means of subsistence | then | “The superior power of population cannot be checked without producing misery or vice.” Is overpopulation a problem? The economics of population size tell a different | less scary | story. While it is certainly possible that some areas can become too crowded for some people’s preferences | as long as people are free to buy and sell land for a mutually agreeable price | overcrowding will fix itself. As an introvert who enjoys nature and peace and quiet | I am certainly less willing to rent an apartment in the middle of a busy | crowded city. The prices I’m willing to pay for country living versus city living reflect my preferences. And | to the extent that others share my preferences or even have the opposite preferences | the use and construction of homes and apartments will economize in both locations. Our demands and the profitability of the varied real estate offerings keep local populations in check. But what about on a global scale? The Inferno villain was concerned with world population. He stressed the urgency of the situation | but I don’t see any reason to worry. Google tells me that we could fit the entire world population in Texas and everybody would have a small | 100 square meter plot to themselves. Indeed | there are vast stretches of land across the globe with little to no human inhabitants. Malthus and his ideological followers must have a biased perspective | only looking at the crowded streets of a big city. If it’s not land that’s a problem | what about the “means of subsistence”? Are we at risk of running out of food | medicine | or other resources because of our growing population? No. A larger population not only means more mouths to feed | but also more heads | hands | and feet to do the producing. Also | as populations increase | so does the variety of skills available to make production even more efficient. More people means everybody can specialize in a more specific and more productive comparative advantage and participate in a division of labor. Perhaps this question will drive the point home: Would you rather be stranded on an island with two other people or 20 other people?

The Best of Jonathan Newman Tags: Jonathan Newman was a 2013 and 2014 Summer Fellow at the Mises Institute and teaches economics at Auburn University.,FAKE,,,‘Inferno’ and the Overpopulation Myth Mises.org November 1 | 2016 Inferno is a great thriller | featuring Tom Hanks reprising his role as Professor Robert Langdon. The previous movie adaptations of Dan Brown’s books ( Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code ) were a success | and I expect Inferno will do well in theaters | too. Langdon is a professor of symbology whose puzzle solving skills and knowledge of history come in high demand when a billionaire leaves a trail of clues based on Dante’s Inferno to a biological weapon that would halve the world’s population. The villain | however | has good motives. As a radical Malthusian | he believes that the human race needs halving if it is to survive at all | even if through a plague. Malthus’s name is not mentioned in the movie | but his ideas are certainly there. Inferno provides us an opportunity to unpack this overpopulation fear | and see where it stands today. Thomas Malthus (1766–1834) thought that the potential exponential growth of population was a problem. If the population increases faster than the means of subsistence | then | “The superior power of population cannot be checked without producing misery or vice.” Is overpopulation a problem? The economics of population size tell a different | less scary | story. While it is certainly possible that some areas can become too crowded for some people’s preferences | as long as people are free to buy and sell land for a mutually agreeable price | overcrowding will fix itself. As an introvert who enjoys nature and peace and quiet | I am certainly less willing to rent an apartment in the middle of a busy | crowded city. The prices I’m willing to pay for country living versus city living reflect my preferences. And | to the extent that others share my preferences or even have the opposite preferences | the use and construction of homes and apartments will economize in both locations. Our demands and the profitability of the varied real estate offerings keep local populations in check. But what about on a global scale? The Inferno villain was concerned with world population. He stressed the urgency of the situation | but I don’t see any reason to worry. Google tells me that we could fit the entire world population in Texas and everybody would have a small | 100 square meter plot to themselves. Indeed | there are vast stretches of land across the globe with little to no human inhabitants. Malthus and his ideological followers must have a biased perspective | only looking at the crowded streets of a big city. If it’s not land that’s a problem | what about the “means of subsistence”? Are we at risk of running out of food | medicine | or other resources because of our growing population? No. A larger population not only means more mouths to feed | but also more heads | hands | and feet to do the producing. Also | as populations increase | so does the variety of skills available to make production even more efficient. More people means everybody can specialize in a more specific and more productive comparative advantage and participate in a division of labor. Perhaps this question will drive the point home: Would you rather be stranded on an island with two other people or 20 other people? Malthus wouldn’t be a Malthusian if he could see this data The empirical evidence is compelling | too. In the graph below | we can see the sort of world Malthus saw: one in which most people were barely surviving | especially compared to our current situation.

691,Pure chaos: Donald Trump’s campaign management offers a glimpse into his governing style (spoiler alert: it’s terrible),If you want a glimpse into a presidential candidate’s governing style | take a look at his campaign. How does he build an organization? How does he manage personnel? How does he delegate responsibility? Does he value loyalty or honesty in advisers? It’s hardly conclusive | but how a candidate deals with these challenges says a lot about what they’d prioritize as president.The presumptive Republican nominee has managed his campaign the way he manages his casinos or his realty TV program: haphazardly and with an unearned arrogance. Everything’s about the brand and non-sycophants are cast aside. Getting it right is far less important than being right. Thus | when prompted by advisers to dial down the rhetoric and think more about his long-term viability | Trump has resisted. He’s yet to understand how different a primary and a general election are | and he’s too cocksure to listen to anyone who tries to explain it.Trump isn’t as stupid as he pretends to be | but his confidence seems to scale with his ignorance | and that’s a dangerous trait in a president | given how consequential each decision can be. As a candidate | a confident idiot can make a lot of noise and fool a lot of voters. But you can’t lead that way. As president | Trump would need the sober advice of serious professionals. Considering how little he understands about the job and the world | this is especially true in his case.Based on the latest behind-the-scenes reports on Trump’s campaign (as well as his entire history in real estate and television) | it’s unlikely he would govern with the humility and self-awareness required. The campaign has undergone several shake-ups in recent months | with key staffers like Corey Lewandowski being demoted to make way for veteran operatives like Paul Manafort. Trump’s approach has remained very much the same | however. Everyone he brings in bends to his will or is replaced by someone who does.Things have gotten more chaotic in the last week or so | as Rick Wiley was fired as the campaign’s national political director. Wiley was known to assert himself in ways that alienated Trump and his loyalists. The Washington Post’s Sean Sullivan and Robert Costa summarized the broader situation over the weekend: “For the last two months | Donald Trump has presided over a political team riddled with turf wars | staff reshuffling and dueling power centers. But tensions are more than typical campaign chaos: They illustrate how Trump likes to run an organization | whether it’s a real estate venture or his presidential bid. Interviews with current and former Trump associates reveal an executive who is fond of promoting rivalries among subordinates | wary of delegating major decisions | scornful of convention and fiercely insistent on a culture of loyalty around him.” These are the management techniques of a brand-hustling magnate | not a president of the United States. Trump’s dictatorial approach works well on the campaign trail | but it’d be a disaster in office. A president has to persuade and compromise. The capacity to admit ignorance is equally important. Trump | by all accounts | has no interest in any of these things. Trump doesn’t know what he needs to know in order to be president | nor does he care that he doesn’t know. If his campaign is any indication | he’ll hire people to ensure his veil of ignorance is never cracked. That kind of megalomania is why Trump is who he is – it’s part of his outsized persona.

They focus on analysis and intelligence of the ongoing crises and the biggest stories from around the world: Ukraine | the war in Middle East | Central Asia issues | protest movements in the Balkans | migration crises | and others. In addition | they provide military operations analysis | the military posture of major world powers | and other important data influencing the growth of tensions between countries and nations. We try to dig out the truth on issues which are barely covered by governments and mainstream media. Syrian War Report – November 1 | 2016: Syrian Military Deploys Advanced T-90 Battle Tanks to Aleppo By South Front on November 1 | 2016 …from SouthFront The Syrian military has deployed advanced Russian-made T-90 main battle tanks to western Aleppo | according to the video released on October 31. T-90 MBTs were observed in the Minyan area where they were participating in operations against Jaish al-Fatah | a Jabhat al-Nusra-led coalition of militant groups. Last weekend | elite units of the Syrian Army’s Tiger Forces and the Desert Hawks Brigade were deployed in Aleppo to counter the militants’ offensive operation to capture the al-Assad Military Academy and the nearby areas. Both formations operate T-90 MBTs supplied by Moscow over the last year. The government forces massively use tanks | artillery | warplanes and helicopters to attrit Jaish al-Fatah’s manpower in non-populated urban areas. Experts note that the jihadists have also concentrated a high number of experienced troops | artillery | rocket launchers and military equipment at a restricted front in western Aleppo. To do this | they had been pushed to use almost all their resources from the rear bases in Idlib province. If Jabhat al-Nusra is not able to achieve a decided success in clashes with the government forces soon | this will lead to its total collapse as a powerbroker in the war. The group’s material and technical base will be destroyed and experienced troops and field commanders killed in the clashes. We’ve been already able to observe signs of this tendency since the failed al-Nusra attempt to dig in the Ramouseh Artillery Acandemy in southern Aleppo. The Kurdish YPG and the Ankara-led forces (Turkish-backed militant groups and the Turkish Armed Forces) have been competing in the northeastern countryside of Aleppo city. Both forces recently captured a bunch of villages from ISIS in the direction of Al-Bab. In this case | the ongoing coordination between the Syrian army and the YPG has once again become reality on the ground. The recent Kurdish operations were coordinated and supported by the Russian and Syrian military and military sources say that Moscow increased military supplies to the YPG in the area. Moscow and Domascus believe that the Kurdish buffer zone plays an important role | preventing Harakat Nour al-Din al-Zenki and other pro-Turkish groups from attacking the Syrian army and its allies in Aleppo city. In mid-October Harakat Nour al-Din al-Zenki officially announced that the next stage of Turkey’s Operation Euphrates Shield will include an advance on the ‘regime forces’ in Aleppo. Dozens of al-Nusra Front and linked-groups members were killed during their failed attempt to break the Syrian army’s defenses at the abandoned al-Mahjoorah Battalion military camp near the militant-controlled town of Ibtaa in the province of Daraa on October 31. According to pro-government forces over 40 militants were killed. Pro-militant media outlets confirm 26 killed in action terrorists.

6484,Why It’s Necessary To Relax Into A Stretch,In a previous article  | I discussed stretching—namely | why stretching is important for the masculine man | and several stretches that you should use in your training to maximize your physical fitness. And while that advice is still valid | I neglected a very important concept in that first article: the techniques that detail how to stretch.I am not referring to a specific stretch or some sort of hypothetical “stretching mindset |” but rather a set of techniques that can be utilized for any stretch to increase ones flexibility immediately. But before I can discuss those | I have to discuss the incorrect way of stretching that many people still use.How Not To Stretch Many people believe that stretching is a literal act of forcing the muscles and connective tissue to stretch— avoid this at all costs ! First and foremost | as I have discussed previously in these pages | you should never apply any stretching pressure to the connective tissue. They evolved solely to “hold fast” and keep things in one piece | they should never be stretched at all!The muscles are the anatomical feature that stretches | as they evolved to do. When stretching | your body should always be positioned in a way where the connective tissues are stable and the muscles are moving.Even when you are positioned properly | no part of stretching should involve the athlete forcing his muscles to stretch | as that risks muscular tearing which is a nagging injury that never truly goes away. This is because the human body has naturally evolved what is referred to as the “ anti-stretch reflex ” to prevent muscular tearing-stretching the muscles increases in difficulty the farther and deeper the stretch is | and your body responds to this stress with pain. This is a biological sign telling you that if you go further you’ll be risking muscle tears | and should normally be a heeded warning.However | if you want to do advanced stretching (such as that nigh-impossible benchmark of fitness the splits) | you will have to find a way to overcome this reflex without hurting yourself. And as luck would have it | there is!Relax Into Stretching Reflexes can be overcome with gradual and repeated practice—just ask your friendly neighborhood hooker about how she overcame her gag reflex! Similarly | your anti-stretch reflex that keeps your “joints” (actually your muscles) stiff and immobile can be overcome with a few techniques.The most basic of these techniques is the one that I have had the best results with (as usual | the simple but difficult answer is usually the correct one) | and that is the titular concept of “relaxing into a stretch”—with thanks to Pavel Tsatsouline for naming the concept.To use this technique | take an easy form of the stretch you want to do: using the splits as an example | you would do a seated groin stretch. Engage the stretch just to the point where you feel tension in the target muscle | and then…sit and wait.Yes | paradoxically | relaxation is the key to increasing your physical fitness in this context. You are literally going to sit there and wait for your muscles to stop fighting the stretch—in other words | you’re going to exhaust your reflex until it stops being reflexive.This is not something that happens quickly—from my experience | it will take 5-10 minutes per stretch | so it is perfectly acceptable for you to get a book or watch TV while doing this. As a side note | this is literally the only time where it’s acceptable to have a visual distraction during exercise | in my opinion.As you might expect | once your muscles have relaxed and the pain has melted away | you can increase the stretch a little bit more | and hold it for another 10 minutes. Repeat this process until your muscles are in pain and you judge that you can’t go any further—this is a personal call that you will have to decide for yourself | as I can’t judge when your muscles are demanding you to stop.This technique can be utilized for any stretch | and in many cases will give you the progress that you so desire. However | there are other methods in the “Relax Into Stretch” family of exercises that can be utilized as well | such as meditation—mentally relaxing will lead to muscular relaxation.Or you can try “forced relaxation” | where you flex the muscle simultaneously while stretching | forcing the muscle to relax.Either way you slice it | don’t just brute force your stretching | utilize these techniques for better results.Read More: Why Stretching Is Essential For The Body (With 6 Beginner Stretches To Get You Started) ,FAKE,,,Why It’s Necessary To Relax Into A Stretch In a previous article  | I discussed stretching—namely | why stretching is important for the masculine man | and several stretches that you should use in your training to maximize your physical fitness.

When stretching | your body should always be positioned in a way where the connective tissues are stable and the muscles are moving.Even when you are positioned properly | no part of stretching should involve the athlete forcing his muscles to stretch | as that risks muscular tearing which is a nagging injury that never truly goes away. This is because the human body has naturally evolved what is referred to as the “ anti-stretch reflex ” to prevent muscular tearing-stretching the muscles increases in difficulty the farther and deeper the stretch is | and your body responds to this stress with pain. This is a biological sign telling you that if you go further you’ll be risking muscle tears | and should normally be a heeded warning.However | if you want to do advanced stretching (such as that nigh-impossible benchmark of fitness the splits) | you will have to find a way to overcome this reflex without hurting yourself. And as luck would have it | there is!Relax Into Stretching Reflexes can be overcome with gradual and repeated practice—just ask your friendly neighborhood hooker about how she overcame her gag reflex! Similarly | your anti-stretch reflex that keeps your “joints” (actually your muscles) stiff and immobile can be overcome with a few techniques.The most basic of these techniques is the one that I have had the best results with (as usual | the simple but difficult answer is usually the correct one) | and that is the titular concept of “relaxing into a stretch”—with thanks to Pavel Tsatsouline for naming the concept.To use this technique | take an easy form of the stretch you want to do: using the splits as an example | you would do a seated groin stretch. Engage the stretch just to the point where you feel tension in the target muscle | and then…sit and wait.Yes | paradoxically | relaxation is the key to increasing your physical fitness in this context. You are literally going to sit there and wait for your muscles to stop fighting the stretch—in other words | you’re going to exhaust your reflex until it stops being reflexive.This is not something that happens quickly—from my experience | it will take 5-10 minutes per stretch | so it is perfectly acceptable for you to get a book or watch TV while doing this. As a side note | this is literally the only time where it’s acceptable to have a visual distraction during exercise | in my opinion.As you might expect | once your muscles have relaxed and the pain has melted away | you can increase the stretch a little bit more | and hold it for another 10 minutes. Repeat this process until your muscles are in pain and you judge that you can’t go any further—this is a personal call that you will have to decide for yourself | as I can’t judge when your muscles are demanding you to stop.This technique can be utilized for any stretch | and in many cases will give you the progress that you so desire. However | there are other methods in the “Relax Into Stretch” family of exercises that can be utilized as well | such as meditation—mentally relaxing will lead to muscular relaxation.Or you can try “forced relaxation” | where you flex the muscle simultaneously while stretching | forcing the muscle to relax.Either way you slice it | don’t just brute force your stretching | utilize these techniques for better results.Read More: Why Stretching Is Essential For The Body (With 6 Beginner Stretches To Get You Started) ,it’s necessary relax stretch previous article discuss stretching—namely stretch important masculine man several stretch use train maximize physical fitness advice still valid neglect important concept first article technique detail stretch.i refer specific stretch sort hypothetical “stretching mindset ” rather set technique utilized stretch increase one flexibility immediately discuss discus incorrect way stretch many people still use.how stretch many people believe stretch literal act force muscle connective tissue stretch— avoid cost first foremost discuss previously page never apply stretch pressure connective tissue evolve solely “hold fast” keep thing one piece never stretch all!the muscle anatomical feature stretch evolve stretch body always position way connective tissue stable muscle moving.even position properly part stretch involve athlete force muscle stretch risk muscular tear nagging injury never truly go away human body naturally evolve refer anti-stretch reflex prevent muscular tearing-stretching muscle increase difficulty far deep stretch body respond stress pain biological sign tell go you’ll risk muscle tear normally heed warning.however want advanced stretch nigh-impossible benchmark fitness split find way overcome reflex without hurt luck would is!relax stretch reflex overcome gradual repeat practice—just ask friendly neighborhood hooker overcame gag reflex similarly anti-stretch reflex keep “joints” actually muscle stiff immobile overcome techniques.the basic technique one best result usual simple difficult answer usually correct one titular concept “relaxing stretch”—with thanks pavel tsatsouline naming concept.to use technique take easy form stretch want use split example would seat groin stretch engage stretch point feel tension target muscle then…sit wait.yes paradoxically relaxation key increase physical fitness context literally go sit wait muscle stop fight stretch—in word you’re go exhaust reflex stop reflexive.this something happen quickly—from experience take minute per stretch perfectly acceptable get book watch tv side note literally time it’s acceptable visual distraction exercise opinion.as might expect muscle relaxed pain melt away increase stretch little bit hold another minute repeat process muscle pain judge can’t go further—this personal call decide can’t judge muscle demand stop.this technique utilized stretch many case give progress desire however method “relax stretch” family exercise utilized well meditation—mentally relax lead muscular relaxation.or try “forced relaxation” flex muscle simultaneously stretch force muscle relax.either way slice don’t brute force stretch utilize technique well results.read stretch essential body beginner stretch get start

9016,2016 interview with Socrates: Another day of Life in the Empire! Are we near an endgame | or fools to ever ‘hope for change’? (6 of ?),Posted on October 27 | 2016 by Carl Herman “It is no use trying to escape their (Empire’s) arrogance by submission or good behavior. Robbers of the world | having by universal plunder exhausted the land | their drive is greed. If the enemy be rich | they are rapacious; if poor | they lust for domination. Neither rule of the East nor West can satisfy them. Alone among men | they crave with equal eagerness poverty and riches. To plunder | slaughter | seize with false pretenses | they give the lying name ‘empire.’ And where nothing remains but a desert | they call that ‘peace.’ ” – Tacitus | The Agricola and the Germania (analyses here  | here ). Tacitus wrote ~ 100 AD | a century into empire. Emperors proclaimed to the public that their government still upheld the highest ideals of their Republic | claiming expanding empire was only and always in “self-defense.” “One Love! Let’s get together and feel all right. Hear the children cryin’ Hear the children cryin’ (One Heart! )” ~ Bob Marley | One Love language warning: Socrates and I speak in the same direct language that caused his execution for “corrupting the young.” Socrates: Carl! Carl: Soc! (bro hug) S: How may I be of service? (genuine smile) C: I just want to talk with an honest person | bro. We last talked 6 months ago . I don’t know if I have anything new to say | but I want to talk with someone who can hear. S: I’ll try. What about? C: We’re finishing a so-called “election” season that’s “jumped the shark” (and here ) with the Left-wing candidate a proven criminal | and Right-wing candidate a depraved Roman Emperor wanna-be . These are Left and Right arms of one illegal rogue state US empire  | of course. S: Of course. C: So I keep feeling that we have to be near an endgame | Soc. We have to be | given the open floodgates of evidence about s much criminal activity by the .01% centered in war  | looting  | and lying . I mean | really | how much longer can this go on?! S: (smiling) Are you asking me | or just pausing for dramatic effect? C: I’m asking if you have any answers. S: (shrugs) I went through a 27-year civil war after almost 50 years of Athenian “leaders” concentrating an empire under their dominion. As we discussed in some detail  | Athen’s “love of freedom” and spin that foreign barbarians “hate us for our freedoms” was total inversion of the facts because “freedom” was only meant for us | and not anyone else. Everyone else had to pay tribute or face military invasion. This hypocrisy in my time produced civil war. Those of us voicing the facts were insufficient to prevent it | or stop it once started. (Pauses to look intensely into my eyes) So you tell me: how much longer could your struggle go on? C: Fuck. I really don’t want a civil war. S: Fuck | indeed. If it comes | maybe you’ll be lucky. Maybe it won’t last 27 years. C: Fuck. S: But I do have a brighter perspective. I mean | how many of the non-sheeple would care to talk with me if all I ever did is leave them discouraged? (chuckles) Who would converse with Socrates if those who did were asked | ‘Hey | how did your conversation with Socrates go?’ and the responses were all disheartened | ‘Fuck!’ (laughs) C: Alright | go. What’s the higher light? S: You already know it. You tell me. C: Ok | you’re right. Maybe my being on Earth is all about growth | truth | and service | and I have to exercise real-world Faith to the One Life. It’s my job as a guest on this planet to harmonize in service to the Goddess ’ plan for Earth. Those of us who are relative beacons of light are isolated by design | obviously | by the facts of our relative leadership and lack of response from the public. (smile) At least I haven’t been voted by my peers for execution | as you were | Soc | for standing for truth. S: Not yet | anyway. If you had taken other pathways | you would have been assassinated by your oligarchs | such as Martin King  | President Kennedy  | and others . C: (sigh) I guess I don’t really have anything new to discuss. I just want to win this game. End the empire. Have truth and love. It’s been a long war | bro. S: Indeed it has. Longer than you know. C: So much bullshit . S: Only bullshit. Any truth has been co-opted | controlled | and used to mask the empire. The only reason I’m allowed onto your history pages is pretense that humanity lives on a planet operated from ideals of virtue. It’s the same with religious ideals of love. C: I’m ready to win. S: So was I. C: (sigh) Alright. So another day in the empire. Ok. Fine. Real-world exercise of Faith. The Goddess has more evolution to oversee with love and wisdom before we see a breakthrough. I can embrace that. It’s really stupid to argue with reality. Really stupid. S: (smiling) Apparently | yes. We have to work with what we have | assuredly. There is no other option. C: We discussed in our previous conversations linked for readers below that the US today compares to your empire in Athens | and the case that perhaps | just maybe | the US is on the verge of breakthrough for Truth and Love. S: Perhaps my history can allow perspective on your world of the present | and encourage Americans today to best use their voice and virtue for a brighter path than the civil war we endured. Certainly for all interested | this consideration is worthy of investing time and attention. History is literally all we know | and what drives our understanding of the present. History is what informs our direction for building the future. America’s history is at war between an awakening We the People and a deeply evil .01% committed to undisclosed vicious empire. Your history could devolve into civil war. (chuckles) As would-be Emperor Trump might say: “Sad.” C: (shaking my head | slight smile). Ok | I gotta’ go to work. Another day in the empire. My vote still stands to planetary management for full fucking truth in a breakthrough. I like a potential trend with revealing e-mails | but want a breakthrough that causes arrests of our .01% leaders in elegant endgame. S: Yes | and I’d like to fly | breath underwater swimming like a dolphin | and have daily dinner parties with wine | music and women! C: (mock agreement) Me | too! Ok | our wants aren’t our best guides | necessarily. I do have to go to work. Back to “earning a living.” S: Make the most of it. It’s your given area of self-expression. C: I promise. I’ll lead by example of my best good-faith expression and experience of virtue. Another day. S: Perhaps just another day. Perhaps you can’t imagine what’s coming. C: Human limitations. I’ll work with what I see. S: That’s all I concluded was possible. That’s all I got for wisdom. I didn’t teach anything other than look for yourself what’s right there in front of you to see. Listen to your small voice within for your best call of virtue. Step-by-step | my brother. In all empathy | live your Faith that you’re loved and guided more than you’re able to imagine.

9757,Hillary Wants Aggressively Interventionist Foreign Policy,"10-27-1 6 The first Bill and Hillary Clinton co-presidency included eight years of Balkan and other wars of aggression. Bush/Cheney exceeded their lawlessness. Obama outdid the worst of both previous administrations - attacking seven countries | destabilizing others | orchestrating coups in Honduras | Paraguay and Brazil | threatening Venezuelan democracy | enforcing puppet rule in Haiti | continuing Plan Colombia aid | responsible for massacres | disappearances and torture of regime opponents | along with instituting increasingly anti-Sino/Russia policies | risking confrontation with both countries. On October 27 | the Wall Street Journal said 2016 electoral politics scrambled traditional positions on foreign policy and international intervention | obliterating many of the usual partisan distinctions and presenting political challenges for whoever wins in November. Hillary will likely exceed the worst of Obamas aggressiveness on the international stage | according to her public statements and (what) top aides say. Shell be more hardline on Russia | China and Iran | risking direct confrontation. Earlier she said I think Ive been very clear that my position is in favor of what I called smart power that uses all the tools at our disposal | and military power always should be a last resort. Her views as first lady | US senator and secretary of state show how often she favors it aggressively | her rage for wars insatiable. As president and commander-in-chief | shell likely circumvent international and constitutional law like her predecessors | waging war on any nation she chooses. Former acting CIA director Michael Morell | a likely Hillary administration appointee | urges a more muscular US geopolitical role | including new sanctions on Russia and Iran | earlier saying: Ships leave Iran on a regular basis carrying arms to the Houthis in Yemen. I would have no problem from a policy perspective of having the US Navy boarding their ships and if there are weapons on them to turn those ships around. This type aggressiveness would risk greater Middle East war than already | maybe involving Russia and China | challenging US interventionism - knowing their nations are next if its not stopped. Earlier | Hillarys top national security advisor Jake Sullivan said (w)e need to be raising the costs to Iran for its destabilizing behavior | and we need to be raising the confidence of our Sunni partners. Last years nuclear deal failed to change overall US policy toward Iran - wanting pro-Western puppet governance replacing its sovereign independence. Instead of cooperating with Iran in furthering regional peace and stability | a Hillary administration appears planning to challenge it confrontationally - perhaps with another war in mind | a far greater challenge than against other Middle East states | especially with Russia likely to intervene if asked.

1967,Both parties want to craft populist messages for 2016,Presidential hopefuls in both parties agree on at least one thing: Economic mobility | and the feeling of many Americans that they are being shut out from the nation’s prosperity | will be a defining theme of the 2016 campaign.Former Florida governor Jeb Bush last week became the latest Republican to signal a readiness to engage Democrats on what historically has been their turf | putting issues of middle-class wage stagnation | poverty and shared prosperity at the forefront of their political messages.Bush’s framing of the economic and social challenges facing the country nearly mirrors that of likely Democratic candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton | as well as other possible contenders on the left. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has written a book on the subject | “American Dreams: Restoring Economic Opportunity for Everyone |” to be published this week | while Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has proposed policies for distressed communities that he sees as “the ticket to the middle class.”And Mitt Romney | the 2012 GOP nominee who was portrayed by Democrats as insensitive to and out of touch with the lives of middle- and working-class Americans | has told friends he considers poverty a topic du jour as he weighs another run in 2016.“You talk to any pollster | on the Democratic side or the Republican side | they’re in complete agreement on the idea that there has to be an economic populist message |” said Matthew Dowd | a top strategist for former president George W. Bush’s 2000 and 2004 campaigns. “Then it comes down to ‘Are there credible solutions and is there a credible candidate?’ ”About 45 million Americans live at or below the poverty line | according to last fall’s census estimates | while the median household income in the United States in 2013 was just under $52 |000. Adjusted for inflation | the median is 8 percent lower than it was in 2007 | the last full year before the recession | and 11 percent below what it was in 2000.Wage stagnation has been a persistent problem for low- and middle-income workers. “Since the late 1970s | wages for the bottom 70 percent of earners have been essentially stagnant | and between 2009 and 2013 | real ­wages fell for the entire bottom 90 percent of the wage distribution |” Lawrence Mishel of the liberal Economic Policy Institute wrote in a paper published this month.Launching his new political action committee | Right to Rise | Jeb Bush asserted last week in the PAC’s mission statement that President Obama’s tenure has been “pretty good” for those at the top of the income scale but a “lost decade” for everyone else.“Millions of our fellow citizens across the broad middle class feel as if the American Dream is now out of their reach; that our politics are petty and broken; that opportunities are elusive; and that the playing field is no longer fair or level |” Bush wrote. “Too many of the poor have lost hope that a path to a better life is within their grasp.”Bush’s focus adds an unexpected element to the coming debate and puts pressure on the entire field | himself included | to come forward with fresh policies that address the nation’s core economic problems.The shift also highlights a potential vulnerability for Democrats. In his campaigns | Obama twice promised to focus on wealth inequality and middle-class stagnation | but those problems persist even as the economy revs up and unemployment falls.Clinton could be challenged now from both the right and the left to lay out solutions that go beyond Obama’s — and also to develop a political voice of her own to articulate them. Democrats conceded after last fall’s midterm elections that they had not found a compelling economic message.Democrats will look to Clinton | should she run | to take the lead in doing that — although they also are looking to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and her harder-edged populist rhetoric.Clinton tested such a message last year. In a major speech at the New America Foundation in May | she said that Americans are “finding it harder than ever to get their footing in our changing economy. The dream of upward mobility that made this country a model for the world feels further and further out of reach.”The language of Bush | Rubio and other Republicans appears aimed at avoiding the problem that bedeviled Romney throughout his 2012 campaign. The former Massachusetts governor’s memorable comment about the “47 percent” of the population who he said depend on government and feel like victims haunted him during the final months before the election.Yuval Levin | editor of the conservative journal National Affairs | said the overall shift in emphasis by Republicans is an effort to move away from Romney’s more abstract message of job growth and to focus more specifically on social mobility and solutions for those at or near the bottom.“It’s a process of letting the light out from under the bushel |” Levin said. Citing past conservative leadership in reforming welfare | he added: “I think Republican ideas have always held this promise | but conservatives have not always emphasized these elements. . . . A difference in emphasis is not insignificant.”Democrats | however | argue that revising their rhetoric will not be enough for Republicans — especially if Jeb Bush becomes the GOP nominee — to gloss over former president George W. Bush’s legacy | which Democrats say tightened the middle-class squeeze.“It’s not like the Republican Party has clean hands on the issue of rising inequality |” said Neera Tanden | president of the Center for American Progress and an adviser to Clinton on economic policy. “It’s a weird thing to say | ‘I care about how the rest of the country is doing | not just the top earners |’ when your brother cut taxes for the wealthy and your party’s economic position starts with undoing Dodd-Frank |” the 2010 law that tightened regulation of Wall Street.Obama hit the road last week to highlight economic successes of his presidency | from the auto industry bailout to more robust overall growth in the last half of 2014. Still | many Democrats acknowledge that there is a large gap between promise and results on issues of middle-class insecurities.That is where Bush and some other Republicans are taking aim. Two factors have contributed to the opening they see.One is the continued problem of stagnating wages for the broad middle class and the income gap between rich and non-rich. The other is new evidence that it has become harder for those at the bottom to rise into the middle class | and that the risk of some born into the middle class — particularly minorities — falling out of it is growing.Democrats long have been seen as the party more trusted to deal with middle-class economic issues. Republicans long have resisted policies that smack of economic redistribution. Could that be changing?“How do you tell the middle class | ‘We’re your guy?’ ” said Grover Norquist | a conservative anti-tax advocate. “Republicans feel comfortable saying that now because they feel the guys they’re running against are sufficiently discredited.”William Galston of the Brookings Institution said that the issue of blocked social mobility is one Republicans will feel more comfortable engaging — and on their own terms. “That’s what Jeb Bush is saying: ‘We can accept a definition of a problem . . . but give unabashedly conservative responses to those challenges |’ ” he said.But Galston | a former domestic policy adviser to President Bill Clinton | said Bush’s framing of the issue this way means he has put down a marker that he will be expected to meet.“I would expect to hear from him over the coming months some of the best and most innovative conservative thinking on opportunity and upward mobility |” he said. “That will be a fair test on how much gas there is in the conservative ideas tank.”Other Republicans have been working to reorient their party toward blue-collar economics and to put forward fresh economic ideas. Former senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee | two former presidential candidates who are looking at running in 2016 | long have talked about the GOP’s need to recognize the problems of working families.House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has focused on policies designed to lift people out of poverty. In 2012 | as Romney’s running mate | Ryan wanted to campaign in inner cities and give speeches promoting individual empowerment. He was frustrated that Romney’s campaign team directed him to talk about other topics.Rubio has proposed a fundamental shift in anti-poverty programs. He has suggested devolving power and responsibility from Washington to the states by consolidating federal monies into a “flex fund.” The senator from Florida has called for significant reductions in federal regulations that he says will spur creation of better jobs. On education | he has offered a series of reforms designed to lessen the burden of student loan debt and expand access to apprenticeship programs. Rubio and others also have proposed changes in the earned-income tax credit to extend its reach to more people.Democrats are skeptical that Republicans can meet the challenge with policy proposals that are much beyond calls for tax cuts to spur economic growth and further efforts to scale back the size of government.“It sounds to me like a ­traditional Romney Republican ­trickle-down agenda but with a willingness to engage on inequality and mobility |” said Jared Bernstein | a former adviser to Vice President Biden who works at the Center of Budget and Policy Priorities.Democrats say it’s too early to draw conclusions | but they note that if Bush and other Republicans find new ways to engage middle-class voters with populist themes | the pressures on Clinton will mount significantly.“Voters are going to [say] | ‘Okay | thank you for acknowledging this problem | but what are you going to do about it?’ ” Bernstein said. “I would argue that Democrats are going to have to have more in their toolbox than [raising the] minimum wage and universal pre-K.”,REAL,,,Both parties want to craft populist messages for 2016 Presidential hopefuls in both parties agree on at least one thing: Economic mobility | and the feeling of many Americans that they are being shut out from the nation’s prosperity | will be a defining theme of the 2016 campaign.Former Florida governor Jeb Bush last week became the latest Republican to signal a readiness to engage Democrats on what historically has been their turf | putting issues of middle-class wage stagnation | poverty and shared prosperity at the forefront of their political messages.Bush’s framing of the economic and social challenges facing the country nearly mirrors that of likely Democratic candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton | as well as other possible contenders on the left.

Citing past conservative leadership in reforming welfare | he added: “I think Republican ideas have always held this promise | but conservatives have not always emphasized these elements. . . . A difference in emphasis is not insignificant.”Democrats | however | argue that revising their rhetoric will not be enough for Republicans — especially if Jeb Bush becomes the GOP nominee — to gloss over former president George W. Bush’s legacy | which Democrats say tightened the middle-class squeeze.“It’s not like the Republican Party has clean hands on the issue of rising inequality |” said Neera Tanden | president of the Center for American Progress and an adviser to Clinton on economic policy. “It’s a weird thing to say | ‘I care about how the rest of the country is doing | not just the top earners |’ when your brother cut taxes for the wealthy and your party’s economic position starts with undoing Dodd-Frank |” the 2010 law that tightened regulation of Wall Street.Obama hit the road last week to highlight economic successes of his presidency | from the auto industry bailout to more robust overall growth in the last half of 2014. Still | many Democrats acknowledge that there is a large gap between promise and results on issues of middle-class insecurities.That is where Bush and some other Republicans are taking aim. Two factors have contributed to the opening they see.One is the continued problem of stagnating wages for the broad middle class and the income gap between rich and non-rich. The other is new evidence that it has become harder for those at the bottom to rise into the middle class | and that the risk of some born into the middle class — particularly minorities — falling out of it is growing.Democrats long have been seen as the party more trusted to deal with middle-class economic issues. Republicans long have resisted policies that smack of economic redistribution. Could that be changing?“How do you tell the middle class | ‘We’re your guy?’ ” said Grover Norquist | a conservative anti-tax advocate. “Republicans feel comfortable saying that now because they feel the guys they’re running against are sufficiently discredited.”William Galston of the Brookings Institution said that the issue of blocked social mobility is one Republicans will feel more comfortable engaging — and on their own terms. “That’s what Jeb Bush is saying: ‘We can accept a definition of a problem . . . but give unabashedly conservative responses to those challenges |’ ” he said.But Galston | a former domestic policy adviser to President Bill Clinton | said Bush’s framing of the issue this way means he has put down a marker that he will be expected to meet.“I would expect to hear from him over the coming months some of the best and most innovative conservative thinking on opportunity and upward mobility |” he said. “That will be a fair test on how much gas there is in the conservative ideas tank.”Other Republicans have been working to reorient their party toward blue-collar economics and to put forward fresh economic ideas. Former senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee | two former presidential candidates who are looking at running in 2016 | long have talked about the GOP’s need to recognize the problems of working families.House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has focused on policies designed to lift people out of poverty. In 2012 | as Romney’s running mate | Ryan wanted to campaign in inner cities and give speeches promoting individual empowerment. He was frustrated that Romney’s campaign team directed him to talk about other topics.Rubio has proposed a fundamental shift in anti-poverty programs. He has suggested devolving power and responsibility from Washington to the states by consolidating federal monies into a “flex fund.” The senator from Florida has called for significant reductions in federal regulations that he says will spur creation of better jobs. On education | he has offered a series of reforms designed to lessen the burden of student loan debt and expand access to apprenticeship programs. Rubio and others also have proposed changes in the earned-income tax credit to extend its reach to more people.Democrats are skeptical that Republicans can meet the challenge with policy proposals that are much beyond calls for tax cuts to spur economic growth and further efforts to scale back the size of government.“It sounds to me like a ­traditional Romney Republican ­trickle-down agenda but with a willingness to engage on inequality and mobility |” said Jared Bernstein | a former adviser to Vice President Biden who works at the Center of Budget and Policy Priorities.Democrats say it’s too early to draw conclusions | but they note that if Bush and other Republicans find new ways to engage middle-class voters with populist themes | the pressures on Clinton will mount significantly.“Voters are going to [say] | ‘Okay | thank you for acknowledging this problem | but what are you going to do about it?’ ” Bernstein said. “I would argue that Democrats are going to have to have more in their toolbox than [raising the] minimum wage and universal pre-K.”,party want craft populist message presidential hopeful party agree least one thing economic mobility feel many

7793,220 ‘Significant’ Pipeline Spills Already This Year Exposes Troubling Safety Record,By Dan ZukowskiThree major U.S. pipeline spills within the last month are just a small part of the 220 significant incidents reported so far this year—and 3 |032 since 2006—that provide a stark reminder of the environmental hazards of an aging pipeline infrastructure carrying fossil fuels. The costs of these leaks since 2006 has amounted to $4.7 billion.1. Oklahoma: On Oct. 24 | the 30-inch S-1 pipeline carrying crude oil from the critical Cushing | Oklahoma hub to refineries and chemical plants on the Gulf Coast began to leak and was shut down overnight. It was the second release connected with the Cushing storage facility in less than a month.2. Pennsylvania: On Oct. 21 | 55 |000 gallons of gasoline gushed from a ruptured Sunoco Logistics pipeline in Williamsport | Pennsylvania | just upstream from the Susquehanna River. Carol Parenzan | Middle Susquehanna Riverkeeper  | said that witnesses who contacted her office reported that the “smell of petroleum is so thick you can taste it.” The 80-year old pipeline was damaged by a heavy storm that dumped seven inches of rain on the area.3. Alabama: Last month | the Colonial Pipeline in Alabama leaked an estimated 336 |000 gallons of gasoline and triggered concerns about gas shortages for drivers in the East. That spill was Colonial’s fifth in the state this year and occurred on a 43-year old section of the pipeline.Based on data from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) | an arm of the U.S. Department of Transportation | the number of significant pipeline incidents grew 26.8 percent from 2006 to 2015. A significant incident is defined as one that results in serious injury or fatality | costs more than $50 |000 | releases more than five barrels of volatile fluids such as gasoline or 50 barrels of other liquids | or results in a fire or explosion. In 2015 | there were 326 such incidents—almost one per day.Some 55 percent of the U.S. network of 135 |000 miles of pipeline is more than 45 years old. Technology designed to detect pipeline leaks is highly unreliable | even though companies like Colonial Pipeline tout their use as a way “to insure safe operations.” But a recent Reuters report found that these technologies are “about as successful as a random member of the public” finding a leak. Of 466 incidents studied by Reuters | only 22 percent | or 105 | were detected by advanced detection systems. The others were found in different ways | with the public finding 99 of the leaks.In testimony before a House subcommittee earlier this year | Carl Weimer | executive director of the watchdog group Pipeline Safety Trust  | said | “Under the current statutes there is no requirement that a pipeline company obtain any permit or permission to operate a pipeline in this country.” Weimer called on Congress to require PHMSA to issue permits for interstate transmission pipelines and ensure that the company follow all rules and regulations.“It is important that we not only maintain our aging energy infrastructure | but that we also remain vigilant about new pipelines and energy interests that threaten water quality |” said Parenzan.Dan Zukowski — Environmental journalist and nature photographer.

Technology designed to detect pipeline leaks is highly unreliable | even though companies like Colonial Pipeline tout their use as a way “to insure safe operations.” But a recent Reuters report found that these technologies are “about as successful as a random member of the public” finding a leak. Of 466 incidents studied by Reuters | only 22 percent | or 105 | were detected by advanced detection systems. The others were found in different ways | with the public finding 99 of the leaks.In testimony before a House subcommittee earlier this year | Carl Weimer | executive director of the watchdog group Pipeline Safety Trust  | said | “Under the current statutes there is no requirement that a pipeline company obtain any permit or permission to operate a pipeline in this country.” Weimer called on Congress to require PHMSA to issue permits for interstate transmission pipelines and ensure that the company follow all rules and regulations.“It is important that we not only maintain our aging energy infrastructure | but that we also remain vigilant about new pipelines and energy interests that threaten water quality |” said Parenzan.Dan Zukowski — Environmental journalist and nature photographer.

2777,Obama makes the right call to tough it out in Afghanistan,The president now plans to continue a U.S. ground force presence in Afghanistan to help hold off the Taliban until he leaves office. This is an uncommon turnaround for a president who hasn’t changed his mind on foreign policy since drawing his (much-ballyhooed and promptly ignored) “red line” in Syria.So what does this rare shift have to say about Obama’s foreign policy and America’s future role in Afghanistan? Not much.Mr. Obama started his presidency hoping to use Afghanistan to demonstrate his willingness to roll up his sleeves and get his hands dirty in the national security business. He asserted that | unlike “Bush’s War” in Iraq | fighting in the place where the 9/11 attacks were concocted was worth it.In approving a surge in Afghanistan | the president made much of his role as decider-in-chief. Yet | even as he sent in more troops | he tipped his hand that Afghanistan was not as much an exception to the talk-don’t-fight Obama Doctrine as the tough-guy image he sought to cultivate.The president gave commanders only half the force and half the time they requested to do the job right. It turned out | the commanders were right.  Mr. Obama | however | had his eye on the next election and wanted to go into the race showing he had put the war on a glide-path to wind down and pull out.Signaling a limited-time interest in fighting an enemy rarely ends well. The Taliban adopted the logical and predictable strategy of simply waiting out Mr. Obama. Also predictably | the half-measure surge and overly ambitious transfer of responsibility to the Afghan military resulted in unnecessarily heavy casualties for Afghan security forces | a persistent Taliban | and a shaky security situation.Nevertheless | Afghanistan is far from a total failure. Indeed |  compared to the president’s other foreign policy dalliances—from the Russian “reset” to Libya to Syria to Iraq to Ukraine— it ranks as his best achievement yet.Which is why Mr. Obama is reportedly backing away from his plan to yank virtually all U.S. troops out of Afghanistan by the end of next year. Instead | he has agreed to leave the current force of 9 |800 troops in place throughout “most” of next year | and keep 5 |500 in theater thereafter.It’s a good call. With the Taliban flexing its muscles anew and the Islamic State making inroads there | completely pulling out makes little sense. Mr. Obama can ill afford another complete foreign policy disaster on his watch.  Further | virtually everyone –the U.S. military | the Afghans | Pakistan | India | our NATO allies— wants the U.S. to stay and see the job through.In addition | there is zero domestic pressure for the president to make good on his campaign promise. An appearance of Code Pink is about as common as a Yeti sighting. And in the debates thus far | presidential candidates have devoted about as much time to Afghanistan as they have to defunding Public Television.It makes complete sense for Mr. Obama to tough it out in Afghanistan | but don’t expect the change in plans to make things better for the Afghans or the larger security picture. The U.S. presence is the bare minimum to hold on. More forces with loser rules of engagement would make the country much safer | much faster.But holding on is probably the best we can hope for with this president.  Here’s hoping the next Commander in Chief’s attitude toward Afghanistan will focus more on solving problems than just wishing they would go away.James Jay Carafano is vice president of foreign and defense policy studies  The Heritage Foundation.

3027,"American politics has reached peak polarization |""For a long time in American politics | we've been trapped in a cycle of ever-escalating political polarization. As measured by voting patterns in the US Congress | the two parties have pulled apart to distances we've never seen before. As measured by consistent partisan positioning among voters | the split in the electorate has reached a historic level of divisiveness.But this is about to end. We've now hit peak polarization. The forces that have fueled the widening gap between the two political parties are now fueling fights within the two political parties | fights that will lead to new coalitions in American politics | eventually realigning the two parties. A new era of American politics is about to emerge.The tautological reason polarization has increased in American politics is that over the past four decades | conflict in American politics has increasingly operated along a single dimension: Republican versus Democrat. A large number of issues that were once nonpartisan or non-ideological have become partisan issues. Almost every policy has now been swept into the maw of partisan jockeying | leaving almost no space for the cross-partisan cooperation our political system relies on to function.In order for congressional polarization to persist | both parties have to maintain tight enough discipline over their members and the political agenda to ensure consistent party voting. And in order for public polarization to persist | parties have to maintain tight enough message discipline among their elites to ensure that their voters only hear one main message.This is breaking down. Republicans are now in open warfare between Trump supporters and #NeverTrumpers. Democrats are far less divided | but internal rifts between their """"establishment"""" (Hillary Clinton) and """"insurgent"""" (Bernie Sanders) wings are also real and likely lasting.This conflict is emerging on issues of international trade | on questions of corporate (especially Wall Street) power | and in growing anger over money in politics and corruption generally. In short | parties are increasingly divided on a growing range of issues that pit their less-educated | lower-income voters who feel left behind by the current political-economic system against their better-educated | higher-income voter who don't want to mess too much with the status quo. These conflicts are not going away anytime soon.This moment is the culmination of four interconnected but ultimately unsustainable trends that have turbocharged polarization over the last two decades:Close competition fueled partisan nastiness and increased the demand for campaign money. The demand for campaign money made the parties more dependent on wealthy donors | which made them less responsive to their voters. This lack of responsiveness provided plenty of evidence for corruption and the felt sense that politics was broken | which fueled anger. Both parties attempted to channel this anger against the other party to distract from their own failures and contradictions and win elections by rendering the other party toxic. This exacerbated the sense that politics was broken and corrupt.These trends created contradictions | and now these contradictions have created openings. Ambitious candidates who could get past their parties' campaign finance gatekeepers had a lot of angry and left-behind voters eager for their message. And this is precisely what Sanders and especially Donald Trump have accomplished. Now there is no going back.These are big claims. So let's flesh this story out a little more | this time with expanded detail.The story could go all the way back to the decisive election of 1932 | when Democrats became the dominant party in American politics for a generation | holding together a big-tent New Deal coalition that included Southern pro-segregationists with Northern urban progressives. But it was an uneasy alliance that could only last as long as civil rights legislation was bottled up. Then in 1964 | the Democrats decidedly became the party of civil rights. And as Lyndon Johnson allegedly acknowledged upon signing the 1964 Civil Rights Act | the Democrats """"have lost the South for a generation.""""Democrats had controlled the South ever since Republican-led Reconstruction (since Republicans were the party of Lincoln and of Reconstruction). But as Republicans came to be the party better aligned with the South on issues of race | conservative Republicans replaced conservative Democrats in Southern House and Senate seats | starting in the 1980s. By 1995 | when Republicans won the House for the first time in 40 years | this transition was mostly complete. By 2011 | it was absolute and total.As this all happened | the ideological center of the Republican Party moved to the South | fusing social and economic conservatism. Northern liberal Republicans were marginalized and soon endangered. Democrats | meanwhile | lost their Southern | conservative wing | and the ideological center of the Democratic Party moved to the coasts and big cities | fusing social and economic liberalism.As the parties became less internally diverse | individual members of Congress delegated more power to their party leaders. After all | they all now basically agreed on the issues. And they wanted leaders who could punish disloyal dissenters and control the agenda. So when Newt Gingrich took over the speakership in 1995 | he centralized power in the position in a way it had not been centralized since 1910.In the 1990s | American politics entered a somewhat unusual period of remarkably close two-party competition for control of the House and the Senate.This | as political scientist Frances Lee explains | has been the catalyst for a very nasty brand of partisan fighting.This seems exactly right to me | and there's lots of evidence to prove it.But not only has this close competition fueled partisanship by turning legislating into zero-sum trench warfare | it has also turbocharged the fundraising dimension of political campaigning.Parties are campaigning harder than ever to win over those swing seats | and this has meant raising ever-expanding sums of money. And in order to raise this money | both parties have had to lean more and more on their wealthiest donors.But relying on these wealthy donors created a problem for both parties. On many issues | particularly economic issues | wealthy elites hold separate opinions from most voters.Major Republican donors generally want fiscal austerity | and particularly a rolled-back welfare state. They also tend to be much more pro-immigration and pro–free trade than Republican voters | and not particularly worried about social issues. But schemes like privatizing Social Security and voucherizing Medicare have never been all that popular with actual Republican voters. And as the middle classes' wages have stagnated | especially for those without college degrees | and the share of foreign-born residents in the US has reached levels not seen since the 1920s (it hit 13.9 percent in 2015) | the voting constituency for anti-immigration populism has grown considerably.Democratic donors are somewhat more economically liberal. But they are not about to support Sanders-style socialism. They prefer Clinton's generally pro-market views. They will tolerate some regulation of business | but not that much | particularly when it's the tech and new economy businesses that they run and invest in.Whereas Democrats once relied on labor unions to get out the vote | by the 1990s unions could no longer provide the support Democrats needed. Democrats instead moved to depend on the """"professional class |"""" deprioritizing workers' concerns to focus instead on the social and environmental concerns that went over much better in Hollywood and San Francisco and Manhattan fundraisers.For a while | both parties could manage these contradictions | being responsive to their donors while pooh-poohing the economic concerns of their less affluent voters on the bland promise that a thriving economy was good for everyone. And for much of the 1990s and 2000s | the economy was doing okay | which generally kept voters from feeling too angry. And to the extent that individual voters weren't benefiting | it was | of course | the other party's fault.As long as both sides were focused on the evils of the other side | and the economy was not in a major recession | party leaders could get away with ignoring many of their voters | and using the campaign contribution proceeds to make their case through more and more negative political advertising and aggressive media messaging.This negativity translated into what political scientists Alan Abramowitz and Steven Webster call """"negative partisanship."""" As they explain:All these interrelated trends have turbocharged polarization over the last two decades. But they relied on both sides being able to control the anger that they were stoking | and on both sides being able to convince their voters that all of the corruption and fecklessness in Washington was because of the other party. This could not go on indefinitely.In fall 2008 the financial crisis hit | and the government bailed out the big Wall Street banks in a very public way. For many | this served as the decisive proof that things really were rigged: Washington and Wall Street were in a corrupt alliance | a conspiracy of career politicians and crony capitalists and lobbyists who were rolling in the money and laughing about it while everyone else was living paycheck to paycheck. As the economy stumbled through recession and then a jobless recovery | economic insecurity and political resentment increased.Obama and the Democrats swept the 2008 election on the strength of anti-Bush feeling and the timeless energy of hope and change. For the first time since 1992 | Democrats had unified control in Washington; Republicans were now out in the cold.With their backs against the wall and Democrats as the new Washington establishment | Republicans now turned their anti-government rhetoric up to 11. Obama was Stalin. Obama was Hitler. Obama was a Kenyan-born Muslim bent on destroying America. Democrats responded to the charges with signature big-government legislation that taxed the middle class so that poor people could have government-subsidized health care. The Republican base went crazy. All their worst fears were confirmed.In 2009 | the Tea Party emerged | representing what felt like new anti-establishment radicalism but was really just the culmination of decades of Republican anti-government rhetoric now freed from any institutional responsibility for actually governing. In 2010 | on the strength of Tea Party anti-Obama energy (and the fact that Democrats had won a bunch of majority Republican House districts in 2006 and 2008) | Republicans swept back into control of the House. In the 2014 election | they finally won back the Senate.But then nothing happened. Obamacare | the devil piñata of every Republican attack | was neither repealed nor replaced. Worse | Republican leaders were negotiating with Obama | Satan himself. They were letting Obama get away with an executive order on immigration. Here was the most corrupt | most crony capitalist administration in history | and what were Republicans in Congress doing? They were rolling over and being just as corrupt!In June 2015 | Donald Trump announced he was running for president and became the immediate frontrunner on the strength of his aggressive anti-immigration stance. Because he had his own money and his own media celebrity | Trump did not need to do the pro-austerity | pro-immigration | pro-free trade dance that other potential frontrunners had done to shake the big donor GOP money tree. He could just run for president | declaring everything was corrupt and he was the only one you could trust because he was the only one who didn't have a super PAC. And he could speak to the working-class Republican voters who had been left behind in this economy | by saying he'd go after China and give them Social Security and Medicare and go after the corrupt hedge fund rip-off artists.And they loved it. For decades | they had been told | for partisan reasons | to be angry; they had been told | for partisan reasons | that Washington was corrupt | and that all Washington politicians were evil. Now they finally had somebody who could say those things while actually not embodying any telltale signs of the sins. They also had somebody who could finally and authentically call out all the """"corrupt"""" things Republican establishment types themselves were doing.A few months later | in September | Republican Speaker John Boehner announced he would resign from Congress | responding to efforts by the House Freedom Caucus to force him out. This was the first time since 1910 that an insurgent faction in the House had successfully challenged a sitting speaker. The anti-establishment anger that Republicans had courted had now finally turned on its leaders.On the Democratic side | anti-Clinton progressives were hoping to draft Elizabeth Warren | who had demonstrated her anti-establishment bona fides in December 2014 | sinking Obama's appointment of Wall Street banker Antonio Weiss for a top Treasury position (Weiss withdrew his nomination | instead accepting a counselor position to Secretary Jack Lew). Warren had also been a prominent opponent of Obama's major Asian free trade agreement.But Warren didn't run. Instead | it was self-identified socialist Bernie Sanders who found the opening. Democratic donor gatekeepers had cleared the field for Hillary. This meant Sanders could get attention just for being the only real alternative | attention that he was able to snowball into a following. Sanders won't win the nomination. But he has done far | far better than anybody ever expected | because a sizable number of Democrat voters share his view that politics is a rigged game where the billionaires and the crony capitalists always win. And like Sanders | they are sick and tired of it.If you briefly scroll back to the top of this article and look at the graph of polarization over time | you'll see a previous peak around 1910 or so. While historical analogies are never perfect | there are some notable similarities between now and around 1910.For one | 1910 was the last time a sitting speaker of the US House had been effectively challenged from within the party. Second | in 1912 the Republican Party was so divided over its presidential nomination that the party splintered | with about half of Republicans supporting Howard Taft (the incumbent) and about half supporting Teddy Roosevelt (the previous incumbent). Democrat Woodrow Wilson won in a landslide.Around 1910 was also when the last great anti-establishment movement in America | the progressive movement | emerged in response to growing concentrations of wealth and political power | concentrations that many Americans felt had left them behind. As political scientist Grant McConnell once wrote of """"the progressive legacy"," it consisted of a """"charges made against virtually all the institutions of American society"""" with """"one common theme — corruption. ... Corruption of such prevalence | disorder of such magnitude could only be explained by something more than the assumption of a slow-spreading decay. The theory of conspiracy was ready at hand and in one way or another it was invoked as an explanation."""" This resonates with today's anti-establishment mood.Political scientist Hans Noel has argued that the emergence of the progressive movement """"crosscut the parties and eventually reshaped them."""" Noel notes that progressives opposed existing authority structures | both economically (e.g. | the """"trusts"""") and politically (they disliked political parties and other authority structures).In 1910 | it was progressive Republican George Norris who led the internal House revolt against Speaker Joe Cannon | stripping Cannon of most of his authority and devolving considerable powers back to individual members | who had increasingly chafed under their marginalization. Like John Boehner in 2015 | Cannon in 1910 represented the culmination of exactly 20 years of increasingly centralized leadership control in the House speakership. Just as Gingrich had radically centralized control in 1995 | Speaker Thomas Reed had radically centralized control in 1890.Parties depolarized in the 1910s and 1920s because | freed of centralized leadership structures | more legislating happened in committees | where a cross-cutting progressive coalition could more freely operate independently of the two parties. Interestingly | trade policy also became much less polarized in the 1920s | with cross-party coalitions on tariff issues.Most likely | Trump will be the Republican nominee. Even if the #NeverTrump forces somehow wrest the nomination from him (unlikely | but possible) | the anti-establishment forces in the Republican Party are not going away. If not Trump (though my guess is he will stick around for a while longer) | somebody in the Tea Party | or possibly even Ted Cruz | will find a way to harness the Trump voters by following the Trump issues playbook. Where there are voters to be had | there are politicians to have them.Meanwhile | in Congress | House Speaker Paul Ryan is already having difficulty building consensus around a budget process. No matter how many speeches he gives about the importance of decorum in politics | it seems increasingly unlikely that he can reconcile the conflicts that Boehner failed to resolve | which means he will have to eventually lean on Democrats to pass a budget and | like Boehner before him | alienate some of his party. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell | much less beloved even within his party | will face similar problems.Most likely | Hillary Clinton will become the 45th US president (she has led in every single head-to-head poll against Trump). And most likely she will use her agenda-setting powers to try to force the Republicans into open civil war by pushing many of the issues that already divide them | especially immigration and trade. Clinton's natural home is in the pro-business center | a position that will be advantageous to her and Democrats in the short term at least. But she has to be cautious. Emboldened by Sanders and by Elizabeth Warren | the progressive wing of the Democrats is growing | and will be unhappy with Clinton's pro-business instincts.The internal fights will continue in both parties. The competing wings of both parties will feel that they are the true Republicans/Democrats. The growing importance of outside | non-party groups in elections will also force ideological diversity onto the parties. Party leaders might instinctually want to wrest power back from these outside groups | but they'd be wiser to open up their tent to allow for different ideas. After all | the party that does best in American politics is always the one that can build the broadest coalition | which means accepting ideological diversity.Eventually | congressional leaders will realize (or be forced to realize) that the only leadership style that works is a less centralized | more committee-driven approach. This is the only way ideologically heterogeneous parties can effectively govern. A more decentralized Congress | with more fluid coalitions | will function better | assuming that a more committee-driven process is also accompanied by increases in congressional staffing capacity. Partisan control of Congress will mean less | since there will be more cross-party coalitions.Many issues | like gun rights or affirmative action | will remain very partisan. But other issues | especially those of corporate/Wall Street power | antitrust | interventionist foreign policy | will likely split the parties. Trump Republicans and Sanders Democrats will find common cause against establishment centrists. Big organized interests | like the Chamber of Commerce and other corporate groups | will align less closely with Republicans | realizing that their future success will require the right mix of Republicans and Democrats to advance their agendas.And as the parties become more ideological diverse | voters | who are generally more ideologically all over the place than the current party alignment would suggest | will identify less reliably with one or the other | since there will be more for them in both parties. They will again sometimes split their tickets | depending on who is running. Many will feel more passionate about individual issues and will align themselves with supporters of those issues in both parties | especially as individual interest groups become cross-partisan in order to achieve policy outcomes. In that respect | politics will come to look more like it did in the 1950s and 1970s | when liberal Republicans existed alongside conservative Democrats.This is an optimistic scenario.But it only works if party leaders tolerate diversity within their party and allow disagreements.Another scenario is that establishment Republicans banish the Trump faction and Democrats banish the Sanders faction after the 2016 elections | and both parties go back to the predictable and intractable trench warfare battle lines that have become increasingly dug in over the past two decades | using nastier and nastier tactics to subvert internal divisions in service of the larger fight against a common enemy. This may be possible for a little while longer (especially if the economy improves significantly) | but it is still probably long-term unsustainable for reasons I've described above. It also may mean that 2020 becomes an even more violent and nasty election.Another possibility is that the parties realign quickly | with the Trump/Tea Party faction effecting a rapid transformation of the Republican Party into a downscale nationalist populist party | pushing the remaining upper-class moderate Republicans into a more pro-business Democratic Party | which in turn pushes some disaffected Sanders voters into the Republican Party. If this realignment happens too quickly | there is no period of depolarization. But this seems unlikely | given the stickiness of partisan identity and the strong disagreements between the two parties on a whole range of other issues.Other scenarios are possible as well | especially if there are significant global crises.But here's the bottom line: Something is different this year in American politics. The logic that has operated for the past two decades or so is breaking down | largely because the factors and trends that propelled it produced unsustainable contradictions. American politics is now entering a new logic | with new trends and forces that will push the lines of political conflict in directions we are only beginning to understand.This feels like chaos | and it is. But it is also good news | because chaos scrambles the rules. We've hit peak polarization. Politics is slowly coming unstuck. A period of new possibilities awaits.This post is part of Polyarchy | an independent blog produced by the political reform program at New America | a Washington think tank devoted to developing new ideas and new voices. See more Polyarchy posts here.""",REAL,,,"American politics has reached peak polarization |""For a long time in American politics | we've been trapped in a cycle of ever-escalating political polarization. As measured by voting patterns in the US Congress | the two parties have pulled apart to distances we've never seen before. As measured by consistent partisan positioning among voters | the split in the electorate has reached a historic level of divisiveness.But this is about to end. We've now hit peak polarization. The forces that have fueled the widening gap between the two political parties are now fueling fights within the two political parties | fights that will lead to new coalitions in American politics | eventually realigning the two parties. A new era of American politics is about to emerge.The tautological reason polarization has increased in American politics is that over the past four decades | conflict in American politics has increasingly operated along a single dimension: Republican versus Democrat. A large number of issues that were once nonpartisan or non-ideological have become partisan issues. Almost every policy has now been swept into the maw of partisan jockeying | leaving almost no space for the cross-partisan cooperation our political system relies on to function.In order for congressional polarization to persist | both parties have to maintain tight enough discipline over their members and the political agenda to ensure consistent party voting. And in order for public polarization to persist | parties have to maintain tight enough message discipline among their elites to ensure that their voters only hear one main message.This is breaking down. Republicans are now in open warfare between Trump supporters and #NeverTrumpers. Democrats are far less divided | but internal rifts between their """"establishment"""" (Hillary Clinton) and """"insurgent"""" (Bernie Sanders) wings are also real and likely lasting.This conflict is emerging on issues of international trade | on questions of corporate (especially Wall Street) power | and in growing anger over money in politics and corruption generally. In short | parties are increasingly divided on a growing range of issues that pit their less-educated | lower-income voters who feel left behind by the current political-economic system against their better-educated | higher-income voter who don't want to mess too much with the status quo. These conflicts are not going away anytime soon.This moment is the culmination of four interconnected but ultimately unsustainable trends that have turbocharged polarization over the last two decades:Close competition fueled partisan nastiness and increased the demand for campaign money. The demand for campaign money made the parties more dependent on wealthy donors | which made them less responsive to their voters. This lack of responsiveness provided plenty of evidence for corruption and the felt sense that politics was broken | which fueled anger. Both parties attempted to channel this anger against the other party to distract from their own failures and contradictions and win elections by rendering the other party toxic. This exacerbated the sense that politics was broken and corrupt.These trends created contradictions | and now these contradictions have created openings. Ambitious candidates who could get past their parties' campaign finance gatekeepers had a lot of angry and left-behind voters eager for their message. And this is precisely what Sanders and especially Donald Trump have accomplished. Now there is no going back.These are big claims. So let's flesh this story out a little more | this time with expanded detail.The story could go all the way back to the decisive election of 1932 | when Democrats became the dominant party in American politics for a generation | holding together a big-tent New Deal coalition that included Southern pro-segregationists with Northern urban progressives. But it was an uneasy alliance that could only last as long as civil rights legislation was bottled up. Then in 1964 | the Democrats decidedly became the party of civil rights. And as Lyndon Johnson allegedly acknowledged upon signing the 1964 Civil Rights Act | the Democrats """"have lost the South for a generation.""""Democrats had controlled the South ever since Republican-led Reconstruction (since Republicans were the party of Lincoln and of Reconstruction). But as Republicans came to be the party better aligned with the South on issues of race | conservative Republicans replaced conservative Democrats in Southern House and Senate seats | starting in the 1980s. By 1995 | when Republicans won the House for the first time in 40 years | this transition was mostly complete. By 2011 | it was absolute and total.As this all happened | the ideological center of the Republican Party moved to the South | fusing social and economic conservatism. Northern liberal Republicans were marginalized and soon endangered. Democrats | meanwhile | lost their Southern | conservative wing | and the ideological center of the Democratic Party moved to the coasts and big cities | fusing social and economic liberalism.As the parties became less internally diverse | individual members of Congress delegated more power to their party leaders. After all | they all now basically agreed on the issues. And they wanted leaders who could punish disloyal dissenters and control the agenda. So when Newt Gingrich took over the speakership in 1995 | he centralized power in the position in a way it had not been centralized since 1910.In the 1990s | American politics entered a somewhat unusual period of remarkably close two-party competition for control of the House and the Senate.This | as political scientist Frances Lee explains | has been the catalyst for a very nasty brand of partisan fighting.This seems exactly right to me | and there's lots of evidence to prove it.But not only has this close competition fueled partisanship by turning legislating into zero-sum trench warfare | it has also turbocharged the fundraising dimension of political campaigning.Parties are campaigning harder than ever to win over those swing seats | and this has meant raising ever-expanding sums of money. And in order to raise this money | both parties have had to lean more and more on their wealthiest donors.But relying on these wealthy donors created a problem for both parties. On many issues | particularly economic issues | wealthy elites hold separate opinions from most voters.Major Republican donors generally want fiscal austerity | and particularly a rolled-back welfare state. They also tend to be much more pro-immigration and pro–free trade than Republican voters | and not particularly worried about social issues. But schemes like privatizing Social Security and voucherizing Medicare have never been all that popular with actual Republican voters. And as the middle classes' wages have stagnated | especially for those without college degrees | and the share of foreign-born residents in the US has reached levels not seen since the 1920s (it hit 13.9 percent in 2015) | the voting constituency for anti-immigration populism has grown considerably.Democratic donors are somewhat more economically liberal. But they are not about to support Sanders-style socialism. They prefer Clinton's generally pro-market views. They will tolerate some regulation of business | but not that much | particularly when it's the tech and new economy businesses that they run and invest in.Whereas Democrats once relied on labor unions to get out the vote | by the 1990s unions could no longer provide the support Democrats needed. Democrats instead moved to depend on the """"professional class |"""" deprioritizing workers' concerns to focus instead on the social and environmental concerns that went over much better in Hollywood and San Francisco and Manhattan fundraisers.For a while | both parties could manage these contradictions | being responsive to their donors while pooh-poohing the economic concerns of their less affluent voters on the bland promise that a thriving economy was good for everyone. And for much of the 1990s and 2000s | the economy was doing okay | which generally kept voters from feeling too angry. And to the extent that individual voters weren't benefiting | it was | of course | the other party's fault.As long as both sides were focused on the evils of the other side | and the economy was not in a major recession | party leaders could get away with ignoring many of their voters | and using the campaign contribution proceeds to make their case through more and more negative political advertising and aggressive media messaging.This negativity translated into what political scientists Alan Abramowitz and Steven Webster call """"negative partisanship."""" As they explain:All these interrelated trends have turbocharged polarization over the last two decades. But they relied on both sides being able to control the anger that they were stoking | and on both sides being able to convince their voters that all of the corruption and fecklessness in Washington was because of the other party. This could not go on indefinitely.In fall 2008 the financial crisis hit | and the government bailed out the big Wall Street banks in a very public way. For many | this served as the decisive proof that things really were rigged: Washington and Wall Street were in a corrupt alliance | a conspiracy of career politicians and crony capitalists and lobbyists who were rolling in the money and laughing about it while everyone else was living paycheck to paycheck. As the economy stumbled through recession and then a jobless recovery | economic insecurity and political resentment increased.Obama and the Democrats swept the 2008 election on the strength of anti-Bush feeling and the timeless energy of hope and change. For the first time since 1992 | Democrats had unified control in Washington; Republicans were now out in the cold.With their backs against the wall and Democrats as the new Washington establishment | Republicans now turned their anti-government rhetoric up to 11. Obama was Stalin. Obama was Hitler. Obama was a Kenyan-born Muslim bent on destroying America. Democrats responded to the charges with signature big-government legislation that taxed the middle class so that poor people could have government-subsidized health care. The Republican base went crazy. All their worst fears were confirmed.In 2009 | the Tea Party emerged | representing what felt like new anti-establishment radicalism but was really just the culmination of decades of Republican anti-government rhetoric now freed from any institutional responsibility for actually governing. In 2010 | on the strength of Tea Party anti-Obama energy (and the fact that Democrats had won a bunch of majority Republican House districts in 2006 and 2008) | Republicans swept back into control of the House. In the 2014 election | they finally won back the Senate.But then nothing happened. Obamacare | the devil piñata of every Republican attack | was neither repealed nor replaced. Worse | Republican leaders were negotiating with Obama | Satan himself. They were letting Obama get away with an executive order on immigration. Here was the most corrupt | most crony capitalist administration in history | and what were Republicans in Congress doing? They were rolling over and being just as corrupt!In June 2015 | Donald Trump announced he was running for president and became the immediate frontrunner on the strength of his aggressive anti-immigration stance. Because he had his own money and his own media celebrity | Trump did not need to do the pro-austerity | pro-immigration | pro-free trade dance that other potential frontrunners had done to shake the big donor GOP money tree. He could just run for president | declaring everything was corrupt and he was the only one you could trust because he was the only one who didn't have a super PAC. And he could speak to the working-class Republican voters who had been left behind in this economy | by saying he'd go after China and give them Social Security and Medicare and go after the corrupt hedge fund rip-off artists.And they loved it. For decades | they had been told | for partisan reasons | to be angry; they had been told | for partisan reasons | that Washington was corrupt | and that all Washington politicians were evil. Now they finally had somebody who could say those things while actually not embodying any telltale signs of the sins. They also had somebody who could finally and authentically call out all the """"corrupt"""" things Republican establishment types themselves were doing.A few months later | in September | Republican Speaker John Boehner announced he would resign from Congress | responding to efforts by the House Freedom Caucus to force him out. This was the first time since 1910 that an insurgent faction in the House had successfully challenged a sitting speaker. The anti-establishment anger that Republicans had courted had now finally turned on its leaders.On the Democratic side | anti-Clinton progressives were hoping to draft Elizabeth Warren | who had demonstrated her anti-establishment bona fides in December 2014 | sinking Obama's appointment of Wall Street banker Antonio Weiss for a top Treasury position (Weiss withdrew his nomination | instead accepting a counselor position to Secretary Jack Lew). Warren had also been a prominent opponent of Obama's major Asian free trade agreement.But Warren didn't run. Instead | it was self-identified socialist Bernie Sanders who found the opening. Democratic donor gatekeepers had cleared the field for Hillary. This meant Sanders could get attention just for being the only real alternative | attention that he was able to snowball into a following. Sanders won't win the nomination. But he has done far | far better than anybody ever expected | because a sizable number of Democrat voters share his view that politics is a rigged game where the billionaires and the crony capitalists always win. And like Sanders | they are sick and tired of it.If you briefly scroll back to the top of this article and look at the graph of polarization over time | you'll see a previous peak around 1910 or so. While historical analogies are never perfect | there are some notable similarities between now and around 1910.For one | 1910 was the last time a sitting speaker of the US House had been effectively challenged from within the party. Second | in 1912 the Republican Party was so divided over its presidential nomination that the party splintered | with about half of Republicans supporting Howard Taft (the incumbent) and about half supporting Teddy Roosevelt (the previous incumbent). Democrat Woodrow Wilson won in a landslide.Around 1910 was also when the last great anti-establishment movement in America | the progressive movement | emerged in response to growing concentrations of wealth and political power | concentrations that many Americans felt had left them behind. As political scientist Grant McConnell once wrote of """"the progressive legacy  it consisted of a """"charges made against virtually all the institutions of American society"""" with """"one common theme — corruption. ... Corruption of such prevalence | disorder of such magnitude could only be explained by something more than the assumption of a slow-spreading decay. The theory of conspiracy was ready at hand and in one way or another it was invoked as an explanation."""" This resonates with today's anti-establishment mood.Political scientist Hans Noel has argued that the emergence of the progressive movement """"crosscut the parties and eventually reshaped them."""" Noel notes that progressives opposed existing authority structures | both economically (e.g. | the """"trusts"""") and politically (they disliked political parties and other authority structures).In 1910 | it was progressive Republican George Norris who led the internal House revolt against Speaker Joe Cannon | stripping Cannon of most of his authority and devolving considerable powers back to individual members | who had increasingly chafed under their marginalization. Like John Boehner in 2015 | Cannon in 1910 represented the culmination of exactly 20 years of increasingly centralized leadership control in the House speakership. Just as Gingrich had radically centralized control in 1995 | Speaker Thomas Reed had radically centralized control in 1890.Parties depolarized in the 1910s and 1920s because | freed of centralized leadership structures | more legislating happened in committees | where a cross-cutting progressive coalition could more freely operate independently of the two parties. Interestingly | trade policy also became much less polarized in the 1920s | with cross-party coalitions on tariff issues.Most likely | Trump will be the Republican nominee. Even if the #NeverTrump forces somehow wrest the nomination from him (unlikely | but possible) | the anti-establishment forces in the Republican Party are not going away. If not Trump (though my guess is he will stick around for a while longer) | somebody in the Tea Party | or possibly even Ted Cruz | will find a way to harness the Trump voters by following the Trump issues playbook. Where there are voters to be had | there are politicians to have them.Meanwhile | in Congress | House Speaker Paul Ryan is already having difficulty building consensus around a budget process. No matter how many speeches he gives about the importance of decorum in politics | it seems increasingly unlikely that he can reconcile the conflicts that Boehner failed to resolve | which means he will have to eventually lean on Democrats to pass a budget and | like Boehner before him | alienate some of his party. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell | much less beloved even within his party | will face similar problems.Most likely | Hillary Clinton will become the 45th US president (she has led in every single head-to-head poll against Trump). And most likely she will use her agenda-setting powers to try to force the Republicans into open civil war by pushing many of the issues that already divide them | especially immigration and trade. Clinton's natural home is in the pro-business center | a position that will be advantageous to her and Democrats in the short term at least. But she has to be cautious. Emboldened by Sanders and by Elizabeth Warren | the progressive wing of the Democrats is growing | and will be unhappy with Clinton's pro-business instincts.The internal fights will continue in both parties. The competing wings of both parties will feel that they are the true Republicans/Democrats. The growing importance of outside | non-party groups in elections will also force ideological diversity onto the parties. Party leaders might instinctually want to wrest power back from these outside groups | but they'd be wiser to open up their tent to allow for different ideas.

4377,Anti-Muhammad cartoon contest: Free speech or deliberately provocative? (+video),"Sponsors say that the shootings in Garland | Texas | confirm their view of Islam as violence-prone. But critics say the event was designed to be incendiary and to poison relations at a volatile time.When Pamela Geller and her controversial organization | the American Freedom Defense Initiative | announced it would hold a cartoon contest in Garland | Texas | their plan to satirize and lampoon the founder of Islam was intended to have both a defiant and provocative free-speech edge.Sunday’s contest and its $10 |000 prize were prompted in part by the Paris Charlie Hebdo massacre in January | Ms. Geller said in March | as well as the riots in Muslim countries sparked by the publication of satirical anti-Muhammad cartoons by a Danish newspaper in 2005. And indeed | as if on cue | two gunmen with apparent ties to Islamic militants overseas tried to storm the heavily secured event in a similar fashion | before being shot dead by a local police officer Sunday night.The incident comes at a time when tensions between some segments of American society and Muslims appear to be becoming more fraught – with protests against Muslims in Texas and anti-Muslim social-media attacks after the release of the film ""American Sniper."" In that context | Geller's actions raise questions about speech seen by many as motivated to incite anger and hatred.It is an issue Geller has faced before. Two weeks ago | she won a federal free-speech case against New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority | which had refused to put up one of her ads: “Killing Jews is Worship that draws us close to Allah” – a quote the ad attributes to “Hamas MTV.”Geller’s organization has often clashed with officials in other cities | including Philadelphia and Washington | over their incendiary ads | some of which compare Islam to Nazism. In 2012 | another federal judge ruled that cities could not refuse to post her subway poster that read: “In any war between the civilized man and the savage | support the civilized man. Support Israel. Defeat Jihad.”Many supporters of Geller and her organization view the violence on Sunday as a vindication of their views of Islam as an inherently violence-prone religion. But for others | her relentless campaign to push the boundaries of free speech with intentionally incendiary messages is only poisoning public discourse at a particularly volatile time.“And coming as it did right when we | the United States of America | are really facing a time when we have to question what it is that holds us together | I can see this potentially aggravating the already-challenging times for dealing with some of these questions about cultural difference | diversity | and what kind of society we want to be |” says Gordon Coonfield | director of graduate studies in communication at Villanova University near Philadelphia.After analyzing some of the submissions to the American Freedom Defense Initiative’s “Muhammad Art Exhibit and Cartoon Contest |” Professor Coonfield pointed out the similarities of some of the depictions of the prophet Muhammad to posters for “Der Ewige Jude |” or “The Eternal Jew |” a notorious Nazi propaganda “documentary.”In one of the cartoons | the prophet is depicted as contorted and snarling and as a hook-nosed man in a turban holding a bloody knife. The caption reads | “When it comes to religion ... I’ve got the edge.” The face | Coonfield notes | is nearly identical to the contorted face of “The Eternal Jew” poster.“That strategy for creating a sense of ‘unity’ by lifting up this internal enemy is as old as human civilization and culture |” he says. “It’s ironic that the kind of thinking that Hitler used | and the Nazis have become famous for using – propaganda to try to create this sense of a collective by creating a strong unquestionably evil Other who is right here in our midst ... so it’s kind of ironic that she’s trying to link some of these things together | when that is in fact her message.”Despite the fact that images depicting the prophet Muhammad cut deeply to the heart of Muslim identity | Muslim leaders in Texas told their followers not to picket or protest the event on Sunday.“Her words are not just free speech |” says Linda Sarsour | executive director of the Arab American Association of New York. “They are inciteful; they incite hate against our whole community. I was very dismayed by the shooting in Garland | Texas | but at the same time | Pamela Geller is not the victim in this situation that we’re in right now.”“She intentionally put that event together in hopes that she’d get the response that she received |” Ms. Sarsour says.“We prayed | but not one Muslim from the state of Texas went out to protest her |” she added. “Muslim leaders specifically told people | do not go anywhere near her. Let her do whatever she does. We don’t care. And there was no protesting outside – unfortunately | except for these two guys from Arizona | who were already on the radar of the FBI anyway.”Advocates have tried to counter Geller’s free political expressions with ad campaigns of a different tone. In 2012 | a coalition called Rabbis for Human Rights responded to her “support the civilized man” poster with an opposing message that read | “In the choice between love and hate | choose love. Help stop bigotry against our Muslim neighbors.”And last week | the makers of the satirical film “The Muslims Are Coming!” launched a humorous series of subway and bus ads to counter Geller's. “The Muslims are coming | and they shall strike with hugs so fierce | you’ll end up calling your grandmother and telling her that you love her.”But in an era in which the Islamic State | the Tsarnaev trial | and the lingering aftermath of 9/11 still inflame fears about Islam | many worry that Sunday’s violence will exacerbate the current tensions.“Free speech is about being open to listening to the ideas you hate the most | that you disagree with the most | and I feel this group in particular is hiding behind this free speech rhetoric |” Coonfield says. “This can’t become the poster child for Christianity versus Islam or the West versus the Middle East. We have to maintain a space where groups that have very different ways of thinking and viewing the world can still come together to talk about it | without resorting to this kind of craziness.”",REAL,,,"Anti-Muhammad cartoon contest: Free speech or deliberately provocative?

9360,Ying and Yang (the Gold and Silver Set-Up),Ying and Yang (the Gold and Silver Set-Up) Posted on Home » Silver » Silver News » Ying and Yang (the Gold and Silver Set-Up) No | this is not a post about some new Chinese law firm. Instead | it’s just an update on the gold and silver markets which | while refusing to go further down | aren’t making much progress to the upside | either. From Craig Hemke | TFMetalsReport : Today’s message: A few more slightly positive US economic datapoints and these are likely enough to make a December FF rate hike a fait accompli. Again | though…and I can’t stress this enough… we have traced out a pattern that is remarkably similar to last October and November in the run up to the most recent FF rate hike. And what happened beginning the very next day? Well | by now you know the story. The week of the October 2o15 FOMC produced a high trade in the Dec15 contract of $1183. As the Fedlines were digested later that week | it became clear that the Fed was going to raise the FF rate at the December 2015 meeting come hell or high water. And they did. However | take a close look at how gold traded in the days and weeks between the Oct15 FOMC and the December rate hike. Price fell from $1180 to $1050 in about five weeks but note that it bottomed well in advance of the actual “news” of the FF rate hike. This 10+% drop was fueled by a near panic level liquidation of the Specs at the Comex. How bad was it? From the CoT survey of 10/27/15 | just one day before that fateful FOMC and Fedlines | the Large Specs in gold were NET long more than 157 |000 contracts while the Commercials were NET short nearly 166 |000. Just five weeks later | the NET position of the Large Specs was down to only 10 |000 contracts with the Commercial position reaching an alltime low of just 2 |911 contracts NET short. We even speculated at the time that there were some days | intraweek | where the Gold Commercials were actually and historically NET LONG. Well now compare last autumn to our current situation. Just as back then | a FF rate hike is a near certainty at the FOMC in December. However | as you know | the anticipatory move in gold began a few weeks ago with the beatdown and purposeful break of both the 50-day and 100-day moving averages in late September. Take a look at the current chart and compare it to the one posted above: In 2015 | we had the October FOMC and then two stout down weeks. Before price turned | we slogged through 5-6 weeks of consolidation and CoT improvement before the blast higher began. In 2016 | we had the September FOMC and then two stout down weeks. Price is attempting to bottom and turn while the CoT improves | but it doesn’t seem ready just yet to begin moving consistently higher. In 2015 | the turn in gold began once the actual rate hike took place. The rate hike and forecast for 3 or 4 more in 2016 led to dollar strength | which led to Chinese devaluations | which led to emerging market crises | which led to equity selloffs and the gold price was already 5-10% off its lows by late January before the real fun began with the USDJPY falling 10% in early February. Are we headed down that same path again? It certainly appears so as the first major salvos of Chinese yuan devaluation were fired last week: http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-20/dear-janet-china-devalues-most-august-yuan-tumbles-lowest-sept-2010 And | just as in 2015 | the CoT is certainly undergoing a makeover | too. From the survey of 9/27/16 | the Large Specs in gold were NET long 292 |000 contracts while the Commercials were NET short 325 |000. As of last Tuesday and just three weeks later | the Large Specs were down to 180 |000 NET long for a reduction of 38% and the Commercials were NET short 203 |000. To be sure | these are still hefty positions but much more “bullish” than the levels seen through the past summer. And now check the full long-term chart. You can see again the similarities between now and last fall. Also be sure to note | however | that the trend has clearly changed and that price is pointed higher. So while we must still deal with the consolidation for a while longer…the Ying and Yang mentioned in the title of this post…it is clear to me that the trend remains higher and that the now-expected FOMC FF rate hike will be simply another “sell-the-rumor | buy-the-news” type of event for gold and silver. This current period of relative quiet should be used to prepare for the next leg UP | not some sort of new bear market where paper prices are sharply falling. Use your time wisely and continue to prepare/stack accordingly.

909,Closed primaries | 'warped' democracy?,Political parties choose their presidential nominees. But with more Americans opting out of parties | is the process representative of what America wants? The New York primary – and others ahead – offer insights.How SNL's 'the bubble' sketch about polarization is all too trueDemocratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders speaks to supporter Michael Cantalupo while taking a walk in New York's Times Square Tuesday. Mr. Cantalupo said he is unable to vote in the New York primariesDenise Guardascione | a waitress for nearly three decades at the Shalimar Diner in Queens | thinks the New York primary process was rigged.She’s a vocal supporter of Republican front-runner Donald Trump | but as a registered Democrat | Ms. Guardascione missed the deadline to switch her registration to become a Republican – which | shocking to her | was more than six months ago.And now | the independent-minded waitress has become bewildered by what seems to be the complicated | back-room system of electing party delegates both in her own state and across the country.“It’s antiquated | it belongs in the Smithsonian | next to Archie Bunker’s chair!” says Ms. Guardascione | a Queens native who works six days a week slinging eggs and coffee for this well-known political haunt. “It’s just for the [expletive] bigwigs and muckety mucks | not us | not the people who just want to vote.”In truth | presidential primaries have never been more open. Since 1972 | primaries have gone from being the province of party bosses to vibrant voter-driven contests. But in this year of populist revolt in both parties | “more open” looks to many voters like “still pretty antiquated.”That is by design. Parties | after all | are not democratic. They can choose their nominees in whichever way they think is best. But at a time when Democrats and Republicans are a shrinking share of the population | closed primaries are shutting more and more of America out.The irony is that America is no less partisan. Research suggests the growing ranks of independents are just as partisan as the parties. These voters have just abandoned parties because they are ashamed by how the parties act.The anger over closed primaries | superdelegates | and convention arcana isn’t likely to help. (Nor are allegations of irregularities in the New York primary. On Thursday | the state's Elections Board suspended the top official in charge of Brooklyn after numerous allegations | the most serious of which is that 125 |000 Democratic voters were incorrectly purged from the rolls before polls opened.)The question is | whether the spotlight of this election could force further change ahead | both in states and in the nation.“New York and other states have long given power to the parties and to the establishment |” says Jeanne Zaino | a political scientist at Iona College in New Rochelle | N.Y. “But who has higher voting turnout? States that have early voting | states that have mail in ballots and same day registration. We in New York allow none of that. This was not just a closed primary | this was an ultra-closed primary. Whether you’re running for office or voting | you had to be on top of your game to be a part of it.”The knock against closed primaries in this election season has been that they hurt insurgent candidates like Trump and Bernie Sanders. But the picture isn’t so simple.Yes | Senator Sanders of Vermont has done much better among independents. But his biggest wins – in Hawaii | Alaska | and Washington state – all came in closed primaries or caucuses.Trump | meanwhile | has in many cases actually done better among Republicans than independents.What is clear is that the primary rules disenfranchise those who most dislike the parties. “So why is Sanders doing so well among independents?” asks Dan Hopkins of the FiveThirtyEight data journalism website. “It appears to be driven not by their ideology so much as their dislike of partisan politics.”In one respect | that makes sense. Why would parties give vote to someone who doesn’t like them?Yet those people are a growing share of the American electorate. Some 39 percent Americans now identify as independents; 32 percent say they’re Democrats | and 23 percent say they’re Republicans | according to a Pew Research Center survey last year.In 2000 | 29 percent were independents | 33 percent were Democrats | and 28 percent were Republicans | Pew foundIn Tuesday’s closed primary | “three million people in the state of New York who are independents have lost their right to vote in the Democratic or Republican primary |” Sanders said. “That’s wrong.”It almost certainly hurt Sanders. In Michigan | for example | Hillary Clinton won the Democratic vote by 58 to 40 percent – similar to the 58 to 42 percent margin in New York. But since Michigan was an open primary where independents could vote | Sanders won the state by taking 71 percent of independent voters.Eight of the 16 remaining primary contests – including Pennsylvania | New Jersey | and Maryland – are closed contests.Sanders and his supporters have also complained about the fact that 15 percent of the delegates to the Democratic National Convention – 712 out of 4 |763 – are party leaders known as “superdelegates |” who overwhelmingly support Mrs. Clinton.In short | the deck is stacked against Sanders. And intentionally so.Sanders isn’t a Democrat; he’s an independent who describes himself as a democratic socialist. It is not illogical that Democratic primaries should favor an actual Democrat.The same is true | in different ways | for Trump. The GOP front-runner won a solid victory in New York. But he's getting little help from the establishment in navigating the complex delegate rules – rules that he says are rigged. Meanwhile | the well-organized campaign of Sen. Ted Cruz outmaneuvered him in Louisiana and swept Colorado’s state convention contest.Presidents have always gone through a complex | multilayered processes in which voters | local officials | and party leaders each have their role | scholars say. Party leaders should have no small say in choosing their party’s presidential nominee | the thinking goes.But even within the parties | there is some restlessness for change. “Closed primaries poison the health of that system and warp its natural balance |” said Charles Schumer (D) of New York | now the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate | to The New York Times in 2014.As America’s political balance increasingly settles outside either of the two parties | 2016 is showing how even a more open system can be warped.“And if part of that story is about disenfranchisement | it is about these younger voters | people who are new to the process | or who disengaged from it and didn’t register | or registered as independent and couldn’t vote |” says Professor Zaino.“You’re talking about Sanders supporters who are going to be on the losing end of that.”,REAL,,,Closed primaries | 'warped' democracy?

1775,Hillary Clinton's declining favorability numbers | in context,Buried beneath Wednesday's eye-popping headlines about Hillary Clinton's sinking favorability ratings | you'll find the reason that she's still on course to win the Democratic primary.First | the headline number: A new Washington Post/ABC News poll shows that 53 percent of Americans have an unfavorable view of Clinton | an 8 percentage point increase since July. Her favorable rating has declined by 7 percentage points to 45 percent over the same period of time | and the split among registered voters is even worse for her | at 56 percent unfavorable to 43 percent favorable. A majority of women (51 percent) now view her unfavorably. None of that is good news for Clinton.She's been on a pretty steady drop from the moment she left the State Department in early 2013. That was a foreseeable outcome of Clinton moving back into domestic partisan politics after four years of representing America's interests abroad. Ellen Tauscher | a former member of Congress and undersecretary of state | warned Clinton that would happen in a private conversation about Clinton's political future in September 2011 | when about two-thirds of Americans rated her favorably.But what's apparent — and of more immediate interest to Clinton — is that she's still better regarded among Democrats than Vice President Joe Biden | who is still weighing whether to run against her. Biden's dead-even 46 percent to 46 percent favorable/unfavorable rating is better than Clinton's | but the edge is based on him having higher numbers with Republicans and independents | the vast majority of whom won't vote in the Democratic primaries.A full 80 percent of Democrats view Clinton favorably | compared with 70 percent who feel that way about Biden. Her number among African Americans is 79 percent | and it's 68 percent among Hispanics. By comparison | Biden is viewed favorably by just 67 percent of African Americans and 49 percent of Hispanics.That helps explain why Clinton is blowing her Democratic competition out of the water in national horse-race polls. She was up 35 percentage points in a head-to-head matchup with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in a PPP poll conducted August 28 to 30 and held a 45-22-18 lead over Sanders and Biden in a Quinnipiac survey conducted from August 20 to 25.She's also doing much better on the favorability scale than either Republican frontrunner Donald Trump or former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Trump checked in with a favorable number that has risen to 37 percent | about the same as Bush's 38 percent. Trump had an unfavorable score of 59 percent | while Bush was at 55 percent.The Clinton ship has taken on water. But | along with other recent surveys | this poll tell us that Clinton is still running away with her party's nomination and remains in better position than any of her Republican or Democratic rivals to advance to the all-important second round of the presidential race. For someone who lost the 2008 primary in part because she looked ahead to the general election | it makes sense to focus on winning the primary first in 2016. On that score | she's still in great shape.,REAL,,,Hillary Clinton's declining favorability numbers | in context Buried beneath Wednesday's eye-popping headlines about Hillary Clinton's sinking favorability ratings | you'll find the reason that she's still on course to win the Democratic primary.First | the headline number: A new Washington Post/ABC News poll shows that 53 percent of Americans have an unfavorable view of Clinton | an 8 percentage point increase since July.

Her number among African Americans is 79 percent | and it's 68 percent among Hispanics. By comparison | Biden is viewed favorably by just 67 percent of African Americans and 49 percent of Hispanics.That helps explain why Clinton is blowing her Democratic competition out of the water in national horse-race polls. She was up 35 percentage points in a head-to-head matchup with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in a PPP poll conducted August 28 to 30 and held a 45-22-18 lead over Sanders and Biden in a Quinnipiac survey conducted from August 20 to 25.She's also doing much better on the favorability scale than either Republican frontrunner Donald Trump or former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Trump checked in with a favorable number that has risen to 37 percent | about the same as Bush's 38 percent. Trump had an unfavorable score of 59 percent | while Bush was at 55 percent.The Clinton ship has taken on water. But | along with other recent surveys | this poll tell us that Clinton is still running away with her party's nomination and remains in better position than any of her Republican or Democratic rivals to advance to the all-important second round of the presidential race. For someone who lost the 2008 primary in part because she looked ahead to the general election | it makes sense to focus on winning the primary first in 2016. On that score | she's still in great shape.,hillary clinton's decline favorability number context bury beneath wednesday's eye-popping headline hillary clinton's sinking favorability rating find reason still course win democratic primary.first headline number new washington post/abc news poll show percent american unfavorable view clinton percentage point increase since july favorable rating decline percentage point percent period time split among registered voter even worse percent unfavorable percent favorable majority woman percent view unfavorably none good news clinton.she's pretty steady drop moment leave state department early foreseeable outcome clinton move back domestic partisan politics four year represent america's interest abroad ellen tauscher former member congress undersecretary state warn clinton would happen private conversation clinton's political future september two-thirds american rat favorably.but what's apparent immediate interest clinton still well regard among democrats vice president joe biden still weigh whether run biden's dead-even percent percent favorable/unfavorable rating well clinton's edge base high number republicans independent vast majority vote democratic primaries.a full percent democrat view clinton favorably compare percent feel way biden number among african american percent percent among hispanic comparison biden view favorably percent african american percent hispanics.that help explain clinton blow democratic competition water national horse-race poll percentage point head-to-head matchup vermont sen bernie sander ppp poll conduct august hold lead sander biden quinnipiac survey conduct august also much good favorability scale either republican frontrunner donald trump former florida gov jeb bush trump check favorable number rise percent bush's percent trump unfavorable score percent bush percent.the clinton ship take water along recent survey poll tell u clinton still run away party's nomination remain good position republican democratic rival advance all-important second round presidential race someone lose primary part look ahead general election make sense focus win primary first score still great shape
8212,Comment on Quid Pro Quo? Wikileaks Email Reveals Clinton Campaign Eyeing Paul Ryan’s Relative for Supreme Court by lenore.lee,New Wikileaks email dumps have revealed massive corruption surrounding Hillary Clinton campaign chair John Podesta . In one email dated February 29 | 2016 | an article sent by Hillary advisor Sara Solow to Podesta and Hillary’s foreign policy advisor Jake Sullivan indicates that the Clinton campaign is considering House Speaker Paul Ryan’s relative for the Supreme Court . Ketanji Brown is the subject of the article. She is related to Paul Ryan by marriage and is a judge on the US District Court for the District of Columbia. The email reads | “She was confirmed by without any Republican opposition in the Senate not once | but *twice*. She was confirmed to her current position in 2013 by unanimous consent – that is | without any stated opposition. She was also previously confirmed unanimously to a seat on the U.S. Sentencing Commission (where she became vice chair).” “Her family is impressive. She is married to a surgeon and has two young daughters. Her father is a retired lawyer and her mother a retired school principal. Her brother was a police officer (in the unit that was the basis for the television show * The Wire *) and is now a law student | and she is related by marriage to Congressman (and Speaker of the House) Paul Ryan.” Earlier this month | he even said he would not campaign for nor support his party’s nominee | Donald Trump . In fact | some supporters of Trump have theorized that Ryan was somehow behind or involved in the leak of the tape in which Trump made sexually crude comments about women. If you claim this is merely circumstantial | then I think there is no hope for you understanding just how corrupt DC has gotten | and this is the very Paul Ryan I warned you about in 2012 | which everyone said was “so conservative.” Sadly | many didn’t listen and voted for liberal Mitt Romney and him. Perhaps Paul Ryan’s records and emails should be leaked and maybe we just might see that he’s willing to engage Hillary in a pay-to-play scheme .

3363,Hillary Clinton: The criminal investigation keeps moving forward,"While the country has been fixated on Donald Trump's tormenting his Republican primary opponents and deeply concerned about the government’s efforts to identify any confederates in the San Bernardino | California | killings | a team of federal prosecutors and FBI agents continues to examine Hillary Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state in order to determine whether she committed any crimes and | if so | whether there is sufficient evidence to prove her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.What began as an innocent Freedom of Information Act request by Judicial Watch | a D.C.-based public advocacy group promoting transparency in the executive branch | has now become a full criminal investigation | with Clinton as the likely target.The basic facts are well-known | but the revealed nuances are important | as well. When the State Department responded to the Judicial Watch FOIA request by telling Judicial Watch that it had no emails from Clinton | Judicial Watch filed a lawsuit. When the State Department made the same representation to the court -- as incredible as it seemed at the time -- the judge accepted that representation | and the case was dismissed.Then The New York Times revealed that Clinton used a private email server instead of the government’s server for all of her work-related and personal emails during her four years as secretary of state. After that | the Judicial Watch FOIA case was reinstated | and then the judge in the case demanded of State that it produce Clinton’s emails.When Judicial Watch expressed frustration to the judge about the pace at which it was getting emails | the judge ordered Clinton | “under penalty of perjury |” to certify that she had surrendered all her governmental emails to the State Department.Eventually | Clinton did certify to the court that she did surrender all of her governmental emails to the State Department. She did so by sending paper copies of selected emails | because she had wiped clean her server. She acknowledged that she decided which emails were personal and which were selected as governmental and returned the governmental ones to the State Department. She has denied steadfastly and consistently that she ever sent or received any materials marked ""classified” while secretary of state using her private server.All of her behavior has triggered the FBI investigation because she may have committed serious federal crimes. For example | it is a crime to steal federal property. What did she steal? By diverting to her own venue the digital metadata that accompany all emails -- metadata that | when attached to the work-related emails of a government employee | belong to the government -- she stole that data. The metadata do not appear on her paper copies -- hence the argument that she stole and destroyed the government-owned metadata.This is particularly troublesome for her present political ambitions because of a federal statute that disqualifies from public office all who have stolen federal property. (She is probably already barred from public office -- though this was not prominently raised when she entered the U.S. Senate or the Department of State -- because of the china | silverware and furniture that she and her husband took from the White House in January 2001.)Clinton may also have committed espionage by failing to secure the government secrets entrusted to her. She did that by diverting those secrets to an unprotected | nongovernmental venue -- her own server -- and again by emailing those secrets to other unprotected and nongovernmental venues. The reason she can deny sending or receiving anything marked ""classified” is that protected government secrets are not marked “classified.”So her statement | though technically true | is highly misleading. The governmental designations of protected secrets are “confidential |” “secret” and “top secret” -- not “classified.” State Department investigators have found 999 emails sent or received by Clinton in at least one of those three categories of protected secrets.Back when Clinton became secretary of state | on her first day in office | she had an hourlong FBI briefing on the proper and lawfully required care of government secrets. She signed a statement | under penalty of perjury | acknowledging that she knew the law and that it is the content of emails | not any stamped markings | that makes them secret.Earlier this week | my Fox News colleagues confirmed the certain presence of top-secret materials among the 999 emails. Intelligence from foreign sources or about foreign governments is always top-secret | whether designated as such or not. And she knows that.As well | she may have committed perjury in the FOIA case. When the House Select Committee on Benghazi | in its investigation of her role in the deaths of the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans | gathered emails | it found emails she did not surrender to the State Department.Last week | the State Department released emails that give the FBI more areas to investigate. These emails may show a pattern of official behavior by Clinton designed to benefit the financial interests of her family's foundation | her husband and her son-in-law. Moreover | the FBI knows of a treasure-trove of documents that may demonstrate that the Clinton Foundation skirted the law and illegally raised and spent contributions.Two months ago | a group of FBI agents sat around a conference table and reviewed the evidence gathered thus far. Each agent was given the opportunity to make or detract from the case for moving forward. At the end of the meeting | it was the consensus of the group to pursue a criminal investigation.And Clinton is the likely target.Andrew P.

1084,Rubio’s parting shot at Trump,It was not supposed to end like this for Marco Rubio.Eleven months ago | he launched his presidential campaign in front of Miami’s Freedom Tower | the Ellis Island for his and other Cuban families. In his rapid rise | young Rubio had been a darling of both the tea party movement and the conservative intelligentsia — the Republicans’ best hope of attracting nonwhite voters.But then came vulgar Donald Trump. Rubio was savaged on everything from immigration to his height. On Tuesday night | Rubio | his campaign fading | lost his home state of Florida to the bigoted demagogue who makes scapegoats of foreigners and minorities. Bowing to the inevitable | Rubio ended his candidacy.By the time Rubio’s campaign bus rolled to its final pre-primary stop — an outdoor basketball court here where he played as a boy — only a couple-hundred supporters were on hand | nearly equaled by the number of journalists on death watch.Before Rubio arrived | a prankster hijacked the microphone and was chased off by campaign aides. When Rubio himself spoke | the sound system failed | so he delivered his valedictory with a bullhorn.[The GOP establishment has failed. It’s up to voters to deny Trump.]Rubio’s voice sounded tinny | but his words were rich with nostalgia as he recalled knocking on doors when he ran for city commissioner here. “In between sips of sweet Cuban coffee | I heard the stories of their youth | of the dreams they lost |” he said. “That has carried me every single day throughout this campaign | knowing that my worst days are better than some of the best days that many people in this community have had.”These are not the best days for Rubio | or for anybody who cares about American democracy. The 44-year-old made mistakes during his campaign: freezing in the New Hampshire debate | failing to take on Trump earlier | then finally attacking Trump by joking about genitalia.Yet he finished honorably. He spoke reflectively Monday about Trump’s brutal transformation of politics. This message should have been delivered much earlier | but it deserves to be heard even now.“Leadership is not about going to an angry and frustrated people and saying you should be even angrier and more frustrated | and you should be angry and frustrated at each other |” Rubio told a gym full of Christian college students in West Palm Beach. “That’s called demagoguery. And it’s dangerous.” It leads | he said | to “where we are today | a nation where people literally hate each other because they’re voting for different candidates. . . . And it leaves us incapable of solving problems.”Trump tore up the norms of decency that remained in American politics | and Rubio expressed puzzlement that it worked. “My whole life I’ve been told being humble is a virtue | and now being humble is a weakness and being vain and self-absorbed is somehow a virtue |” he said. “My whole life I’ve been told no matter how you feel about someone | you respect everyone because we are all children of the same God — and now being respectful to one another is considered political correctness.”Rubio voiced regret for his own role in the vulgarity | saying he “felt terrible” for joking about Trump’s penis size. Such remorse separates Rubio from Trump | who seems to have no shame as he blurts obscenities | delivers insults and winks at violence. “There are people | I know | who like this stuff because he says what they want to be able to say | [but] presidents can’t say whatever they want to say |” Rubio told the students | mentioning the harm to America’s reputation that Trump has already done. “We’re not a Third World country. We’re the United States of America.”[Donald Trump just threatened more violence. Only this time | it’s directed at the GOP.]That’s the welcoming country to which Rubio’s parents immigrated | settling among the shoe-box homes here in Cuban West Miami. “Everywhere I go I tell the story of this community of people | many of whom lost their country in their youth |” Rubio said Monday night in his boyhood park | his kids beside him in the bed of his Dodge pickup.He spoke | in English | then in Spanish | with the requisite optimism | telling supporters he looked forward to moving his “caja china” — Cuban barbecue — to the White House.“If there’s no car | we’ll go in a raft!” a supporter said in Spanish.Another said in English: “Don’t give up | man!”But Rubio’s speech to his modest band had the ring of a farewell. “I will always be a son of this community. I will always carry with me the hopes and dreams of generations that made possible the dreams of mine |” he said. His candidacy | he said | “was possible because you and I happen to live in the one place on Earth where even the son of a bartender and a maid from West Miami can be president.”Or at least he can lose to a trash-talking rich guy from Queens.Read more from Dana Milbank’s archive | follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.,REAL,,,Rubio’s parting shot at Trump It was not supposed to end like this for Marco Rubio.Eleven months ago | he launched his presidential campaign in front of Miami’s Freedom Tower | the Ellis Island for his and other Cuban families.

2669,Why it's funny Republicans are upset with Facebook: Column,GOP opposes the kind of antitrust regulation that would preserve freedom of expression online.America’s right wing is in a froth about allegations that Facebook has tweaked its “trending news” feed to reduce the visibility of conservative news sites.It’s not clear if the allegations | from a Gizmodo report based on anonymous sources | are true and Facebook denies them. But the deeper problem is undeniably real: Facebook is the dominant member of a small number of giant entities — corporate and governmental — that are gaining control over news | freedom of expression and much of our digital lives. The irony is that the conservatives and business-backed Republicans in Congress who howl about Facebook are the same people who have thwarted policies that would encourage the competition we need to challenge that increasingly centralized control.Almost no one wants to address the fact that Facebook is becoming a monopoly in the antitrust sense of the word. Along with Google | it dominates online advertising; Facebook especially does so on mobile devices | which are the way many people connect to the Internet. If you offer news and information online | you have almost no choice but to play on Facebook’s field because so much of your audience is there. (In some parts of the world | Facebook essentially is the Internet | because mobile devices are pretty much the sole means of online access and in some cases the company has made deals with local telecommunications companies and | or governments.)Facebook has been buying everything that presents even a whiff of competition: Instagram | WhatsApp | Oculus. This is smart — no one can dispute that Mark Zuckerberg and the others on his team are brilliant technologists and strategists — but it’s also a red flag. As Zuckerberg famously said several years ago | he wants Facebook to be “like electricity.” Well | electricity is a utility. And we regulate utilities.Monopolies and cozy oligopolies never turn out well in the long run for anyone but the monopolists or cartel members. They end up controlling markets and do their best to thwart genuine competition. It’s their nature. Which is why capitalism | plainly the best system when it’s working right | needs rules to promote competition.Yet Republicans | in general | think the government should play little to no role in promoting competition. They consider antitrust inquiry and enforcement to be counterproductive | at best — except | of course | when a powerful constituent (a corporation | usually) is in danger from predatory behavior.That attitude accounts for the GOP’s cheerleading for corporate dominance of Internet access. Republicans | in general | are fine with the idea that one or two companies (say the leading cable provider and another telecom) should control access in most communities | and utterly opposed to a remedy — what we call network neutrality — to ensure that people at the edges of networks | not dominant Internet service providers | should decide what information they want and at what priority.I don’t want the government to tell Facebook what it can publish and don’t look forward to much more than posturing from Congress. But I do want the government to start paying extremely close attention to the way the company is becoming a monopoly and to what it means for freedom of expression when a single company has so much power over what people say online. I want government to use antitrust and other pro-competition laws to ensure that Facebook doesn’t abuse its dominance in a business sense. I want government(s) to promote open technology and communications | and fierce competition at every level. Kudos to Zuckerberg for making Facebook so appealing to millions of users; that’s an amazing achievement. But we can’t allow Facebook to leverage that success to block the emergence of alternatives to its service | or use its market power to influence or alter the content of publications and others trying to communicate with Facebook users.We all need to wake up to the potential threat Facebook poses to freedom of expression. Once you are in its enclosed online space | it is the corporation’s terms of service | not the First Amendment | that determines what you can say. If it decides to downplay speech it doesn’t like | Facebook has the right to do so.So I’m glad that conservatives are concerned | even if the allegations prove overblown. (Facebook has modified its outright denial to a “we’re looking into it” stance; stay tuned.) I’d be even happier if conservatives realized that government does have a role in promoting genuine competition — and that we’re in uncharted information-freedom territory under the new control freaks of Silicon Valley.Dan Gillmor teaches digital media literacy at Arizona State University.

3648,FBI checking if Orlando shooter's wife knew attack plan but didn't warn police,The wife of the gunman who carried out the deadliest mass shooting on American soil could face criminal charges if investigators conclude that she knew of the attack in advance but failed to warn police.Noor Zahi Salman told that FBI that her husband | Omar Mateen | had said he was going out to see friends | but she feared he was going to attack a gay nightclub | NBC News reported on Wednesday. She tried to talk him out of it but did not contact law enforcement agencies.Wielding an AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle and a handgun | Mateen opened fire at the Pulse club in Orlando | Florida | early on Sunday in a three-hour shooting rampage and hostage siege that ended when a Swat team smashed its way in and killed him. There were 49 people killed and 53 were injured.Angus King | a member of the Senate intelligence committee | which received a briefing on the attack | told CNN: “It appears she [Salman] had some knowledge of what was going on. She definitely is | I guess you would say | a person of interest right now and appears to be cooperating and can provide us with some important information.”Peter King | chairman of the House homeland security subcommittee on counterintelligence and terrorism | told MSNBC: “If it’s true that she did know that it was going to happen and she tried to talk him out of it | then it’s possible criminal action (could be taken) against her | and again there might be more involvement by her | so all that has to be investigated.”The possibility that Mateen | 29 | did not act alone but received support from other individuals or groups is now central to the FBI’s inquiry | King added. “If there’s anybody else that he was dealing with | anyone else he was talking with | anyone else who may have known about this | this is all where the investigation is going now.”Media reports also suggested that Salman was with her husband when he bought ammunition and a holster. She allegedly told the FBI that she once drove him to Pulse | nearly a two-hour drive from their home in Fort Pierce | Florida | because he wanted to scope it out. Mateen is said to have browsed militant Islamist material on the internet for at least two years before the mass shooting.As detectives tried to piece together Mateen’s last movements on Saturday night | Orlando mayor Buddy Dyer | who opened a family assistance centre in a stadium on Wednesday | said: “What I know concretely is that he was driving around that evening and visited several locations.”The FBI director | James Comey | has said the agency is trying to determine whether Mateen had recently visited Disney World | one of the Orlando’s celebrated theme parks | to consider it as a potential target.Disney | which is donating $1m to an official fund for victims of the shooting | installed metal detectors last December but declined to comment on the Mateen case. A spokesperson said: “Unfortunately we’ve all been living in a world of uncertainty | and we have been increasing our security measures across our properties for some time | adding such visible safeguards as magnetometers | additional canine units | and law enforcement officers on site | as well as less visible systems that employ state-of-the-art security technologies.”Salman will be key to the ongoing investigation as conflicting narratives emerge | including evidence he had been influenced by militant Islamist ideas and reports he might have struggled with his own sexual identity.A survivor of the massacre | Patience Carter | suggested on Tuesday that Mateen had an overt political motive. Cowering in a bathroom | she heard him demand that Americans “stop bombing his country” and pledge allegiance to Islamic State | she said.Carter | 20 | who is African American | told reporters at Florida Hospital: “He even spoke to us directly in the bathroom. He said | ‘Are there any black people in here?’ I was too afraid to answer but there was an African American male in the stall | where the majority of my body was | who had answered and he said | ‘Yes | there are about six or seven of us |’ and the gunman responded back to him and said: ‘You know | I don’t have a problem with black people. This is about my country. You guys suffered enough.’”The account chimed with previous FBI statements that Mateen had called the 911 emergency service and made reference to both Isis and the Tsarnaev brothers | who were responsible for the Boston bombings. Investigators have said Mateen was probably self-radicalised and there is no evidence that he received any instruction or aid from outside groups such as Isis.Mateen also called a local 24-hour cable news channel | News 13 | the station revealed on its website on Wednesday. Matthew Gentili | who was the producer on duty at the time | recalled that Mateen said: “I’m the shooter. It’s me. I am the shooter ... I did it for Isis. I did it for the Islamic State.”Soon after the attack | Mateen’s father indicated that his son had strong anti-gay feelings. He recounted an incident when his son became angry when he saw two men kissing in downtown Miami while out with his wife and young son.Several media reports quoted men as saying they had seen Mateen at Pulse many times or that he had contacted them via gay dating apps | such as Grindr and Jack’d. But Pulse denied that he had ever been a patron. “Untrue and totally ridiculous |” spokeswoman Sara Brady said in an email to Reuters.Mateen’s ex-wife | Sitora Yusufiy | told CNN she did not know if he was gay but added: “Well | when we had gotten married | he confessed to me about his past that was recent at that time and that he very much enjoyed going to clubs and the nightlife and there was a lot of pictures of him.”“I feel like it’s a side of him or a part of him that he lived but probably didn’t want everybody to know about.”Asked by the Guardian about rumours his son was gay | Mateen’s father Seddique Mateen said: “It’s not true. Why | if he was gay | would he do this?”Seddique Mateen declined to comment specifically on the investigation on Wednesday | saying: “The FBI | they always do a professional job and to the maximum extent of my ability I will support them.”Mateen | investigated twice by the FBI | was on the government’s terrorist watchlist for 10 months before being taken off. G4S | the security company that employed Mateen | only psychologically evaluated him once | at the start of his nine-year employment with the company and not again after the company was made aware he had been interviewed by the FBI.Thirty-three people remain in hospital | including six in critical condition. On Tuesday | the first of the seriously injured to speak of their trauma was Angel Colon at the Orlando Regional Medical Center. “He’s shooting everyone that’s already dead on the floor | making sure they’re dead |” he said | speaking from a wheelchair. “I look over | and he shoots the girl next to me. And I’m just there laying down and I’m thinking: ‘I’m next | I’m dead.’“So I don’t know how | but by the glory of God | he shoots toward my head but it hits my hand | and then he shoots me again and it hits the side of my hip. I had no reaction. I was just prepared to just stay there laying down so he won’t know that I’m alive.”The attending trauma surgeon on call that night | Dr Chadwick Smith | said: “It was singularly the worst day of my career and the best day of my career. And I think you can say that of pretty much every person standing up here.”The atrocity continued to reverberate in Washington DC | where Senate Democrats demanded tighter gun controls. Donald Trump | the Republican presumptive nominee | broke ranks with the party by saying he would meet the influential National Rifle Association lobbying group | which has endorsed him | to discuss an idea for restricting gun purchases by people on terrorism watchlists.Barack Obama | who will visit Orlando on Thursday | launched a blistering assault against Trump over the candidate’s anti-Muslim rhetoric | which the president described as dangerous and contrary to American values.“Where does this stop? The Orlando killer | one of the San Bernardino killers | the Fort Hood killer | [they] were all US citizens. Are we going to start treating all Muslim Americans differently? ... Putting them under surveillance?”,REAL,,,FBI checking if Orlando shooter's wife knew attack plan but didn't warn police The wife of the gunman who carried out the deadliest mass shooting on American soil could face criminal charges if investigators conclude that she knew of the attack in advance but failed to warn police.Noor Zahi Salman told that FBI that her husband | Omar Mateen | had said he was going out to see friends | but she feared he was going to attack a gay nightclub | NBC News reported on Wednesday. She tried to talk him out of it but did not contact law enforcement agencies.Wielding an AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle and a handgun | Mateen opened fire at the Pulse club in Orlando | Florida | early on Sunday in a three-hour shooting rampage and hostage siege that ended when a Swat team smashed its way in and killed him. There were 49 people killed and 53 were injured.Angus King | a member of the Senate intelligence committee | which received a briefing on the attack | told CNN: “It appears she [Salman] had some knowledge of what was going on. She definitely is | I guess you would say | a person of interest right now and appears to be cooperating and can provide us with some important information.”Peter King | chairman of the House homeland security subcommittee on counterintelligence and terrorism | told MSNBC: “If it’s true that she did know that it was going to happen and she tried to talk him out of it | then it’s possible criminal action (could be taken) against her | and again there might be more involvement by her | so all that has to be investigated.”The possibility that Mateen | 29 | did not act alone but received support from other individuals or groups is now central to the FBI’s inquiry | King added. “If there’s anybody else that he was dealing with | anyone else he was talking with | anyone else who may have known about this | this is all where the investigation is going now.”Media reports also suggested that Salman was with her husband when he bought ammunition and a holster. She allegedly told the FBI that she once drove him to Pulse | nearly a two-hour drive from their home in Fort Pierce | Florida | because he wanted to scope it out. Mateen is said to have browsed militant Islamist material on the internet for at least two years before the mass shooting.As detectives tried to piece together Mateen’s last movements on Saturday night | Orlando mayor Buddy Dyer | who opened a family assistance centre in a stadium on Wednesday | said: “What I know concretely is that he was driving around that evening and visited several locations.”The FBI director | James Comey | has said the agency is trying to determine whether Mateen had recently visited Disney World | one of the Orlando’s celebrated theme parks | to consider it as a potential target.Disney | which is donating $1m to an official fund for victims of the shooting | installed metal detectors last December but declined to comment on the Mateen case. A spokesperson said: “Unfortunately we’ve all been living in a world of uncertainty | and we have been increasing our security measures across our properties for some time | adding such visible safeguards as magnetometers | additional canine units | and law enforcement officers on site | as well as less visible systems that employ state-of-the-art security technologies.”Salman will be key to the ongoing investigation as conflicting narratives emerge | including evidence he had been influenced by militant Islamist ideas and reports he might have struggled with his own sexual identity.A survivor of the massacre | Patience Carter | suggested on Tuesday that Mateen had an overt political motive. Cowering in a bathroom | she heard him demand that Americans “stop bombing his country” and pledge allegiance to Islamic State | she said.Carter | 20 | who is African American | told reporters at Florida Hospital: “He even spoke to us directly in the bathroom. He said | ‘Are there any black people in here?’ I was too afraid to answer but there was an African American male in the stall | where the majority of my body was | who had answered and he said | ‘Yes | there are about six or seven of us |’ and the gunman responded back to him and said: ‘You know | I don’t have a problem with black people. This is about my country. You guys suffered enough.’”The account chimed with previous FBI statements that Mateen had called the 911 emergency service and made reference to both Isis and the Tsarnaev brothers | who were responsible for the Boston bombings. Investigators have said Mateen was probably self-radicalised and there is no evidence that he received any instruction or aid from outside groups such as Isis.Mateen also called a local 24-hour cable news channel | News 13 | the station revealed on its website on Wednesday. Matthew Gentili | who was the producer on duty at the time | recalled that Mateen said: “I’m the shooter. It’s me. I am the shooter ... I did it for Isis. I did it for the Islamic State.”Soon after the attack | Mateen’s father indicated that his son had strong anti-gay feelings. He recounted an incident when his son became angry when he saw two men kissing in downtown Miami while out with his wife and young son.Several media reports quoted men as saying they had seen Mateen at Pulse many times or that he had contacted them via gay dating apps | such as Grindr and Jack’d.

596,Handicapping the Hispanic vote for 2016 GOPers,The last Texas Republican to occupy the Oval Office | George W. Bush | took 49 percent of the state’s Hispanic vote in his 2004 presidential re-election | setting a relatively high bar for the handful of Texas-born or -raised Republicans who might be hoping to follow in his footsteps in 2016.Republican presidential aspirants with ties to the Lone Star State must figure out how to hold the GOP base and attract conservative Hispanics if they want to be successful in Texas | political observers say.So how do the party's four most prominent Texas affiliated might-be candidates — former Gov. Rick Perry; Jeb Bush | the son and brother of two former presidents from the state; Texas’ junior U.S. senator | Ted Cruz; and U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky — stack up in the early going?For Republicans to avoid a repeat of 2012 | when presidential nominee Mitt Romney took only 27 percent of the Hispanic vote nationwide | they need to nominate a conservative candidate who can go into Hispanic communities and truly connect with voters | said Hector De Leon | co-chairman of the Associated Republicans of Texas | which reaches out to Hispanic voters.“It’s all about paying attention |” De Leon said.Hispanics made up 10 percent of the national electorate in the 2012 presidential election. But in Texas | they make up almost one-third of eligible voters. And there’s plenty room for improvement when it comes to voter turnout. Only 39 percent of Texas Hispanics eligible to vote cast ballots in 2012.Political observers say candidates would be right to take a page out of George W. Bush’s playbook on Hispanic outreach. He solidified his winning record with Hispanics with help from Latino-media guru Lionel Sosa | who told The Texas Tribune he has been in talks with Jeb Bush about his possible presidential bid.Sosa helped George W. Bush’s campaign craft several television ads that painted him as the candidate who understood Hispanic culture. The candidate who can mobilize on-the-fence Hispanic voters who usually do not turn out to vote could win the state.“I do think the primaries will include a concerted effort by some candidates to speak to that constituency |” said Sylvia Manzano | a senior analyst for the nonpartisan political polling organization Latino Decisions. “In Texas | that’s 10 million people. That’s a number that cannot be ignored.”Though it's still early in the game | many political observers say Jeb Bush is best positioned at the moment. He grew up in Midland | spent much of his childhood in Houston and is considered friendly to the Hispanic community | both personally and politically.“Jeb Bush is not going to come in and play mariachi politics |” Manzano said. “He knows better than that.”But this far out | all is speculation. As the candidates tiptoe toward the starting gate | here's how several political experts handicap the field.Already holding a political advantage because he is fluent in Spanish | the former Florida governor has experience winning over Hispanics in a state where they make up a large part of the population. During his 1998 re-election campaign | Bush won an impressive 61 percent of Florida's Hispanic electorate. It's worth noting | though | that Florida’s mostly Cuban Hispanic population differs from Texas | where a majority of Hispanics have roots in Mexico.What the experts say:For Bush | reaching out to Texas Hispanics would be an extended family affair. Aside from benefiting from the groundwork his family has done in the state | expect to see Bush campaigning with his Mexican-born wife | Columba | and his son | Texas Land CommissionerGeorge P. Bush | at his side. George P. is also fluent in Spanish and helped found Hispanic Republicans of Texas | a political group that recruits and supports Hispanic Republicans running for public office.Bush’s record on issues that resonate with Texas Hispanics | particularly immigration reform | could prove attractive to this voting group. He has urged Congress to pass immigration reform and has highlighted it as a key issue in helping Republicans win Hispanics. He also gained national attention last year when he said many of those entering the country illegally do so out of an “act of love” for their families.As the state’s longest-serving governor | Perry has long courted Texas Hispanics. He has steadily improved his standing since winning only 13 percent of the Hispanic vote when he defeated Hispanic businessman Tony Sanchez of Laredo in 2002. By the time he was re-elected in 2010 | Perry pulled in 38 percent of Hispanic voters.What the experts say:Perry’s efforts to broaden his appeal were buoyed by the passage of the Texas Dream Act during his 14-year tenure. Though the future of the law granting in-state tuition to some undocumented immigrants is unclear | Perry has stood by it both on the national stage and at home. During a 2011 presidential debate | Perry famously told opponents who challenged his support of the law that they had no heart. More recently | as the state’s new GOP leadership works to overturn the law | Perry has been vocal about his continued support for it.Because he presided over the state’s economic boom in the last decade | Perry has a unique opportunity to appeal to Hispanics on economic issues. If Perry can convince Hispanic voters that they benefited from the so-called Texas Miracle | he may be able to sway some on-the-fence voters his way.Though he is the only Hispanic in the group — and the first Hispanic senator from Texas — Cruz has largely avoided making heritage part of his political persona beyond recounting his father’s journey to the United States from Cuban as an exile in 1957. Still | he has done well with Texas Hispanics. In 2012 | he outperformed Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney | taking 35 percent of the Hispanic vote | according to a Latino Decisions poll.What the experts say:Cruz arguably faces the toughest challenge courting Texas Hispanics given his divisive tone on immigration and health care. He has been vocal in his opposition to President Obama’s executive order on immigration | which will grant millions of undocumented immigrants work permits and reprieve from deportation proceedings. The order is widely popular among Hispanics. On health care | Cruz has been one of the biggest foes of the federal Affordable Care Act. Texas Hispanics — who make up a large portion of the state’s uninsured population —overwhelmingly support the health law.Though Paul was elected to the Senate from Kentucky | where Hispanics make up only 3 percent of the population | he grew up in Lake Jackson | Texas | where Hispanics are one-fifth of the population. Paul has spent the last few months preaching a message of Hispanic inclusion within the Republican ranks.What the experts say:Paul is someone to watch in the upcoming election when it comes to appealing to Texas Hispanics because of his views on growing the GOP’s number of Hispanic supporters. Because he is largely unknown among Texas Hispanics | Paul also has some room to improve his standing. A November 2014 poll by Latino Decisions found that almost a third of Texas Latino voters have no opinion of Paul.,REAL,,,Handicapping the Hispanic vote for 2016 GOPers The last Texas Republican to occupy the Oval Office | George W.

6061,Truth Will Out Radio: The Laconia Incident,Radio Aryan October 28 | 2016 Sven Longshanks  | Dennis Wise and Messerschmitt bring us another episode of Truth Will Out Radio | this week looking at the Laconia incident and the British Freikorps. Messerschmitt deviates somewhat with his Axis War Heroes series in that the main subject is not a person but the so-called “Laconia Incident”. In September 1942 a German U-boat under the Command of Werner Hartenstein torpedoed the British troopship Laconia. As Hartenstein realized that a lot of Italian prisoners of war and even civilians including women and children were among the survivors struggling for their lives he ordered that as many as possible were to be taken on board the U-boat. Even though he radioed his intentions to all surrounding vessels in plain English and had a Red Cross flag draped across the U-boat he and the survivors they were carrying were attacked by an American B-24. What happened to the survivors and what the response of the German Navy was when it learned of this atrocity is elaborated on by Schmitt and the presentation ends with a letter from a relative of one of the casualties | thanking the U-boat commanders for their courageous and honourable behaviour. This presentation shows how the Allies were breaking the rules of war while the Germans were keeping to their treaties. During the Nuremberg trials this incident was brought up in the hopes of convicting Admiral Doenitz for advising the U-boats not to pick up survivors | but it had the inadvertent effect of exposing the British and Americans of waging unrestricted submarine warfare | in itself a possible war crime as it breaks the law of the sea that any shipwrecked mariners must be rescued | no matter who they are. Dennis points out the hypocrisy of the British and Americans in this before reminding us that not all the British behaved like this during the war. Some became members of the Freikorps and fought to defend Europe from the Bolshevik menace alongside the other SS Volunteer Legions. These heroes were called traitors by the British establishment | yet their oath was to protect Europe from Communism | not to fight against Britain. It is a testament to the truthful ideology of National Socialism that prisoners of war could be set free to fight against Communism once they had heard the truth about it from their kinsmen in the League of St George. After giving us a brief history of these brave young British men | Dennis and Sven conclude the podcast by talking about the importance of race and how the Freikorps highlighted this in their propaganda.

1641,2016 Republican race enters a new | volatile phase,The fight for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination appears to be moving into a new | more fluid phase.No longer is the question merely whether or how Donald Trump can be stopped.The recent rise in the polls of retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson — Trump’s low-key stylistic opposite — has shown that the celebrity billionaire may not be the only one who can tap the appetite of many in the party’s angry base for an outsider.And after Wednesday’s chaotic and freewheeling debate | there also is a new dynamic on the establishment side of the race.Former Florida governor Jeb Bush’s once-formidable campaign appears to be nearing a state of collapse | made worse by his flailing on the stage in Colorado.That has provided an opening to his onetime ally | Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida | who is getting a new look from the party establishment — an ironic situation | given Rubio’s roots as an insurgent tea party favorite in 2010.“Marco Rubio now has probably the best shot to emerge as the mainstream alternative to Trump and Carson |” said Ari Fleischer | who was press secretary for President George W. Bush.More broadly | Fleischer | who is not committed to any of the 2016 candidates | predicted that the GOP is about to enter “a condensed version of where it was four years ago | where the party is volatile and shopping around.”That could help Ted Cruz | who also made a strong showing in the debate. The firebrand senator from Texas | widely despised by the Washington Republican hierarchy | is looking to nudge out Trump and Carson among voters who are looking for a candidate to supplant the old order.“I don’t think the party is going to nominate anybody who has not been elected before |” said Stuart Stevens | who was a top strategist for 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney.Also likely to force some clarity in the coming weeks is the calendar. The first contest | in Iowa | is barely more than three months away.So the focus for all the leading contenders will have to shift | from raising their profiles nationally to refining the strategies and organization it will take to put specific states in their column.“The campaign is really in a nuts-and-bolts stage |” said Trump’s campaign manager | Corey Lewandowski. “It’s about getting on the ballot | organizing | and making sure people understand what caucuses are in Iowa and other states and teach them how to participate. It’s about getting people committed and ready.”Lewandowski said Trump’s campaign is already hiring staff for states that do not hold their primaries until March.“Our approach is to execute and meet the criteria to get on the ballot in all 50 states | in five territories and in the District of Columbia. That’s a full-time job |” he added. “This campaign is doing all of the things necessary for long-term success.”At the same time | Trump seemed to be moderating and refining his message as he campaigned outside Reno | Nev. | Thursday afternoon.Where he previously has devoted his rallies to slinging insults at his opponents and boasting about his poll numbers | Trump focused instead on describing the professional and life experience he would bring to the White House.He also cited issues where he claimed to have led before it was a popular thing to do — including opposing the Iraq war and aggressively combating illegal immigration.“That’s the kind of thinking we need in the country |” Trump said. “A lot of the people in the audience | maybe in your small way you have that same thinking.”Bush | campaigning in New Hampshire | insisted that his struggling candidacy should not be counted out. The former Florida governor | who is polling in the single digits almost everywhere | insisted | “We’re doing fine.”But he appeared to acknowledge that he had not helped his prospects with his showing in the debate.“Look | there are two types of politicians. There are the talkers and there are the doers |” Bush told the crowd. “I wish I could talk as well as some of the people on the stage | the big personalities on the stage | but I’m a doer.”Rubio | meanwhile | must capi­tal­ize — quickly — on whatever interest and momentum may be generated by his debate performance. He spent the morning making the rounds of six network and cable television shows and the remainder of the day fundraising in Denver and Chicago. He will be in Iowa on Friday.On “CBS This Morning |” Rubio declined to criticize Bush personally and said the differences between the two will be fleshed out in terms of policy.“I’m going to continue to tell people who I am | what I’m for. There are policy differences between us — we’ll discuss those. Americans deserve to hear those. But I’m not going to change my campaign |” he said.“Jeb is my friend | I have admiration for him. I’m not running against him. I’m running for president.”Cruz | meanwhile | is building what GOP insiders say is a strong organization. The campaign says that it has 77 |000 volunteers on the ground | with 6 |000 in the first four voting states.Fundraising has also been robust — and was reignited by the debate | during which the senator trained his fire on the CNBC moderators and the media. A Cruz aide said more than $1 million had poured in since Wednesday night’s debate.There will be growing pressure on candidates who are getting no traction to get out of the race. On Thursday | for instance | the New York Times editorial board called upon New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to abandon his bid.“New Jersey is in trouble | and the governor is off pursuing a presidential run that’s turned out to be nothing more than a vanity project |” the paper wrote. “Mr. Christie’s numbers are in the basement | and he’s nearly out of campaign cash. This is his moment | all right: to go home and use the rest of his term to clean out the barn | as Speaker John Boehner would say.”Christie | for his part | tweeted | “Can’t read the article because I don’t have a subscription | but I can tell you this — I am not going anywhere.”Robert Costa in Colorado and Jenna Johnson in Nevada contributed to this report.,REAL,,,2016 Republican race enters a new | volatile phase The fight for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination appears to be moving into a new | more fluid phase.No longer is the question merely whether or how Donald Trump can be stopped.The recent rise in the polls of retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson — Trump’s low-key stylistic opposite — has shown that the celebrity billionaire may not be the only one who can tap the appetite of many in the party’s angry base for an outsider.And after Wednesday’s chaotic and freewheeling debate | there also is a new dynamic on the establishment side of the race.Former Florida governor Jeb Bush’s once-formidable campaign appears to be nearing a state of collapse | made worse by his flailing on the stage in Colorado.That has provided an opening to his onetime ally | Sen.

139,‘Hands up | don’t shoot’ was built on a lie,The late evening of Aug. 9 | 2014 | I couldn’t sleep. I was due to substitute-anchor MSNBC’s “UP with Steve Kornacki” and should have been asleep. But after looking at my Twitter feed and reading the rage under #Ferguson | I felt compelled to type a reaction to the killing of Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson. Tying the shooting to the inane whine of certain politicians about a “war on whites |”  I decried the next morning the death of yet another unarmed black man at the hands of a white police officer.In those early hours and early days | there was more unknown than known. But this month | the Justice Department released two must-read investigations connected to the killing of Brown that filled in blanks | corrected the record and brought sunlight to dark places by revealing ugly practices that institutionalized racism and hardship. They have also forced me to deal with two uncomfortable truths: Brown never surrendered with his hands up | and Wilson was justified in shooting Brown.The report on the Ferguson police department detailed abuse and blatant trampling of the constitutional rights of people | mostly African Americans | in Ferguson. Years of mistreatment by the police | the courts and the municipal government | including evidence that all three balanced their books on the backs of the people of Ferguson | were laid bare in 102 damning pages. The overwhelming data from DOJ provided background and much-needed context for why a small St. Louis suburb most had never heard of exploded the moment Brown was killed. His death gave voice to many who suffered in silence.The unarmed 18-year-old also became a potent symbol of the lack of trust between African Americans and law enforcement. Not just in Ferguson | but in the rest of the country. Lord knows there have been plenty of recent examples. And the militarized response to protesters by local police put an exclamation point on demonstrators’ concerns. But the other DOJ report | the one on the actual shooting of Michael Brown | shows him to be an inappropriate symbol.Through exhaustive interviews with witnesses | cross-checking their statements with previous statements to authorities and the media | ballistics | DNA evidence and results from three autopsies | the Justice Department was able to present a credible and troubling picture of what happened on Canfield Drive. More credible than the grand jury decision to not indict Wilson. The transcript of his grand jury testimony read like so much hand-holding by the prosecution.What DOJ found made me ill. Wilson knew about the theft of the cigarillos from the convenience store and had a description of the suspects. Brown fought with the officer and tried to take his gun. And the popular hands-up storyline | which isn’t corroborated by ballistic and DNA evidence and multiple witness statements | was perpetuated by Witness 101. In fact | just about everything said to the media by Witness 101 | whom we all know as Dorian Johnson | the friend with Brown that day | was not supported by the evidence and other witness statements.Page 6: Brown then grabbed the weapon and struggled with Wilson to gain control of it. Wilson fired | striking Brown in the hand. Autopsy results and bullet trajectory | skin from Brown’s palm on the outside of the SUV door as well as Brown’s DNA on the inside of the driver’s door corroborate Wilson’s account that during the struggle | Brown used his right hand to grab and attempt to control Wilson’s gun. According to three autopsies | Brown sustained a close range gunshot wound to the fleshy portion of his right hand at the base of his right thumb. Soot from the muzzle of the gun found embedded in the tissue of this wound coupled with indicia of thermal change from the heat of the muzzle indicate that Brown’s hand was within inches of the muzzle of Wilson’s gun when it was fired. The location of the recovered bullet in the side panel of the driver’s door | just above Wilson’s lap | also corroborates Wilson’s account of the struggle over the gun and when the gun was fired | as do witness accounts that Wilson fired at least one shot from inside the SUV.Page 8: Although there are several individuals who have stated that Brown held his hands up in an unambiguous sign of surrender prior to Wilson shooting him dead | their accounts do not support a prosecution of Wilson. As detailed throughout this report | some of those accounts are inaccurate because they are inconsistent with the physical and forensic evidence; some of those accounts are materially inconsistent with that witness’s own prior statements with no explanation | credible [or] otherwise | as to why those accounts changed over time. Certain other witnesses who originally stated Brown had his hands up in surrender recanted their original accounts | admitting that they did not witness the shooting or parts of it | despite what they initially reported either to federal or local law enforcement or to the media. Prosecutors did not rely on those accounts when making a prosecutive decision. While credible witnesses gave varying accounts of exactly what Brown was doing with his hands as he moved toward Wilson – i.e. | balling them | holding them out | or pulling up his pants up – and varying accounts of how he was moving – i.e. | “charging |” moving in “slow motion |” or “running” – they all establish that Brown was moving toward Wilson when Wilson shot him. Although some witnesses state that Brown held his hands up at shoulder level with his palms facing outward for a brief moment | these same witnesses describe Brown then dropping his hands and “charging” at Wilson.The DOJ report notes on page 44 that Johnson “made multiple statements to the media immediately following the incident that spawned the popular narrative that Wilson shot Brown execution-style as he held up his hands in surrender.” In one of those interviews | Johnson told MSNBC that Brown was shot in the back by Wilson. It was then that Johnson said Brown stopped | turned around with his hands up and said | “I don’t have a gun | stop shooting!” And | like that | “hands up | don’t shoot” became the mantra of a movement. But it was wrong | built on a lie.Yet this does not diminish the importance of the real issues unearthed in Ferguson by Brown’s death. Nor does it discredit what has become the larger “Black Lives Matter.” In fact | the false Ferguson narrative stuck because of concern over a distressing pattern of other police killings of unarmed African American men and boys around the time of Brown’s death. Eric Garner was killed on a Staten Island street on July 17. John Crawford III was killed in a Wal-Mart in Beavercreek | Ohio | on Aug. 5 | four days before Brown. Levar Jones survived being shot by a South Carolina state trooper on Sept. 4. Tamir Rice | 12 years old | was killed in a Cleveland park on Nov. 23 | the day before the Ferguson grand jury opted not to indict Wilson. Sadly | the list has grown longer.Now that black lives matter to everyone | it is imperative that we continue marching for and giving voice to those killed in racially charged incidents at the hands of police and others. But we must never allow ourselves to march under the banner of a false narrative on behalf of someone who would otherwise offend our sense of right and wrong. And when we discover that we have | we must acknowledge it | admit our error and keep on marching.

3854,"To get around Congress | Obama turns to city halls |""WASHINGTON — President Obama has quietly racked up a series of legislative victories during the past few months as lawmakers have enthusiastically embraced his calls for a higher minimum wage | paid sick leave and universal pre-kindergarten.Instead of Capitol Hill | those victories happened in city halls | state houses and county buildings far from Washington.At least six major cities — Chicago | Philadelphia | Pittsburgh | Seattle | Tacoma | Wash. | and Washington | D.C. — have passed paid sick leave laws in the four months since Obama called for state and local action in this year's State of the Union Address. Since the 2013 address when Obama called for an increase in the minimum wage | 17 states and six major cities have taken action | including Los Angeles last week.Obama's state-and-local strategy may be unprecedented in its scope and ambition. Though previous administrations have appointed top advisers to listen to concerns of state and local officials | the Obama White House appears to be the first to aggressively use those same channels to encourage them to adopt Obama's policies.""""It is a change in the paradigm | where we used to sit passively by waiting for elected officials to come to us. We think we can have a more substantial impact if we collaborate |"""" said Valerie Jarrett | the assistant to the president for public engagement and intergovernmental affairs.""""I think the president has always had the perspective that change always happens from the ground up | and our state and local officials are oftentimes more influenced by the will of the American people than the politics in Washington would seem to indicate |"""" Jarrett said in an interview.Obama has no formal authority over state and local lawmakers | so his persuasion is a form of soft power — the """"phone"""" part of what Obama has described as a """"pen-and-phone"""" strategy to take action in the absence of congressional cooperation.He's found fertile ground in Democratic-run cities such as Seattle | where Mayor Ed Murray helped push for a minimum wage and paid leave laws that have gone into effect since April.""""President Obama recognizes that good ideas are being incubated at the local level | and those are ideas that are going to go to scale nationally |"""" Murray said. That recognition can go a long way in a city such as Seattle | which often doesn't get the national attention East Coast cities do. """"The president of the United States recognizing us only helps us. We do other things beside e-commerce and coffee |"""" Murray said.There's also resistance. Jon Russell is a councilman in Culpeper | Va. | and the director of the American City County Exchange | a year-old initiative of the small-government American Legislative Exchange Council.Russell said states — not cities | not Congress and not the president — should be the primary regulator of labor conditions. Obama | he said | is """"hop-skipping over the states.""""""""With the number of states that have now turned to the opposite political party | he doesn't have the allies there that he used to |"""" Russell said. """"To work with the urban areas to push his agenda is not surprising. It's the only allies he really has.""""The strategy has been more effective on some policies than others. Since last September | more than 200 mayors have signed on to the My Brother's Keeper initiative | a commitment to help boys and young men of color. But since Obama called for states to offer free community college in January | only a handful have moved in that direction.The state-and-local strategy effort has been particularly effective on paid leave policies | which Obama championed in his State of the Union Address this year. """"Forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave — 43 million. Think about that |"""" Obama said. """"So I'll be taking new action to help states adopt paid leave laws of their own.""""That pledge came with a $1 million budget from the Department of Labor to help fund feasibility studies for state and local governments | which will begin to be awarded this summer.Obama dispatched Jarrett and Labor Secretary Tom Perez on a """"Lead on Leave"""" tour of cities that have adopted paid leave policies. Jarrett went to Philadelphia and Chicago; Perez has been to Portland | Ore. | Pawtucket | R.I. | St. Petersburg | Fla. | and Seattle.Tuesday | Perez will be in Minneapolis | which just adopted a paid leave policy for city employees this month.Perez said it's a mistake to view the state-and-local strategy as separate from a larger effort. """"Our strategy is an all-of-the-above-and-then-some strategy |"""" he said.He said Obama will continue to use executive orders | as he did when he increased the minimum wage for federal contractors to $10.10 an hour.""""We want Congress to act | and I'm confident that it's a when question | not an if question. But we're also not going to wait around for Congress to act |"""" Perez said.Although focusing on city councils may seem small compared with the sweeping congressional legislation early in Obama's presidency | state minimum wage laws will raise the pay of more than 7 million people by 2017. (That number | which comes from the White House Council of Economic Advisers | includes people making just above minimum wage who were helped indirectly because their wages are increased accordingly.)""""That's nothing to sneeze at. That's progress |"""" Jarrett said.San Francisco passed the first paid sick time law in the nation in 2006 | requiring all employers to grant one hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours worked. Three states and 18 cities now have paid sick leave laws on the books | according to A Better Balance | a New York-based legal advocacy group that tracks such laws.A year ago | advocates had a hard time breaking through the public consciousness on the issue | said the group's co-president | Sherry Leiwant. After a White House Working Families Summit last year | and again after January's State of the Union Address | there's been an """"explosion"""" of interest by state and local lawmakers | she said.""""The White House leadership on this issue has been huge. It's had a real impact |"""" Leiwant said. """"That influence on mayors or governors | who are Democrats but haven't paid a lot of attention to this issue | or they want to be pro-business Democrats | this gives them a lot of cover.""""A Better Balance still favors a national law that would cover everyone | but while the government is divided at the national level | """"the best strategy is to go to localities and states.""""A city-by-city strategy can be painstaking and legally complicated. Every state grants different home rule powers to cities — and even different powers to different-sized cities in the same state.Philadelphia was able to pass a paid leave bill applying to private-sector workers | but Pittsburgh's law applies only to some non-union city workers. Pittsburgh City Councilwoman Natalia Rudiak credits Obama for giving her city's effort """"a lot of momentum |"""" but she said more cities need to put pressure on the state Legislature to adopt statewide law.There's also pushback from the opposite direction. Last month | the Pennsylvania Senate voted 37-12 to preempt the Philadelphia law | taking the power to regulate sick leave out of the hands of local governments.That bill's sponsor | state Sen. John Eichelberger Jr. | said it's untenable to have 2 |562 municipalities with different labor standards | forcing businesses to comply with a patchwork of rules.""""Philosophically | I have a real problem with President Obama going to a municipality and trying to accomplish an agenda | whether it's liberal or conservative or otherwise |"""" he said. """"It's just not the place to adopt these policies.""""Obama has opened an entirely new frontier of presidential power by turning to state and local governments | said Matthew Eshbaugh-Soha | who studies the effect of presidential persuasion at the University of North Texas.""""I'm really struck by | one | why hasn't anybody thought of this before? And two | this could be a very effective strategy |"""" Eshbaugh-Soha said. """"At a time when executive orders are becoming particularly controversial and you're not able to break through the gridlock of Congress | I think it's ingenious.""""He's skeptical that the effort will put much pressure on members of Congress who don't support Obama's policies.Jarrett said the effort is starting to snowball. She said some city leaders agreed with paid leave on principle but were reluctant to pass what could be seen as burdensome regulations in a difficult economy. As more cities and states have passed those policies | it's emboldened others.""""Success begets success |"""" she said. """"What the evidence has begun to show is it's not a burden but an investment that is starting to pay off.""""Indeed | Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter vetoed two paid leave bills in 2011 and 2013. But three weeks after Obama's State of the Union Address this year | Nutter reversed course.What changed? Nutter said the economy was better | and the bill contained key compromises to accommodate small businesses. Nutter spokesman Mark McDonald said he was unaware of any role Obama had in getting the bill passed.Bill Greenlee | the councilman who sponsored the measure | said Nutter """"completely turned a corner"""" on paid leave when the president put it on his agenda. """"I gotta think that when the president mentions sick leave in his State of the Union | and if you're a Democrat and a supporter of the president's agenda in general | that's gotta have an effect"," Greenlee said.Nutter did make a symbolic nod to Obama's influence in signing the paid leave bill: He signed it with a pen Obama gave him — after the president used it to sign an unemployment compensation bill. The only other time Nutter used that pen was on an executive order raising the minimum wage for city contractors to $12 an hour.""",REAL,,,"To get around Congress | Obama turns to city halls |""WASHINGTON — President Obama has quietly racked up a series of legislative victories during the past few months as lawmakers have enthusiastically embraced his calls for a higher minimum wage | paid sick leave and universal pre-kindergarten.Instead of Capitol Hill | those victories happened in city halls | state houses and county buildings far from Washington.At least six major cities — Chicago | Philadelphia | Pittsburgh | Seattle | Tacoma | Wash. | and Washington | D.C. — have passed paid sick leave laws in the four months since Obama called for state and local action in this year's State of the Union Address.

Three states and 18 cities now have paid sick leave laws on the books | according to A Better Balance | a New York-based legal advocacy group that tracks such laws.A year ago | advocates had a hard time breaking through the public consciousness on the issue | said the group's co-president | Sherry Leiwant. After a White House Working Families Summit last year | and again after January's State of the Union Address | there's been an """"explosion"""" of interest by state and local lawmakers | she said.""""The White House leadership on this issue has been huge. It's had a real impact |"""" Leiwant said. """"That influence on mayors or governors | who are Democrats but haven't paid a lot of attention to this issue | or they want to be pro-business Democrats | this gives them a lot of cover.""""A Better Balance still favors a national law that would cover everyone | but while the government is divided at the national level | """"the best strategy is to go to localities and states.""""A city-by-city strategy can be painstaking and legally complicated. Every state grants different home rule powers to cities — and even different powers to different-sized cities in the same state.Philadelphia was able to pass a paid leave bill applying to private-sector workers | but Pittsburgh's law applies only to some non-union city workers. Pittsburgh City Councilwoman Natalia Rudiak credits Obama for giving her city's effort """"a lot of momentum |"""" but she said more cities need to put pressure on the state Legislature to adopt statewide law.There's also pushback from the opposite direction. Last month | the Pennsylvania Senate voted 37-12 to preempt the Philadelphia law | taking the power to regulate sick leave out of the hands of local governments.That bill's sponsor | state Sen. John Eichelberger Jr. | said it's untenable to have 2 |562 municipalities with different labor standards | forcing businesses to comply with a patchwork of rules.""""Philosophically | I have a real problem with President Obama going to a municipality and trying to accomplish an agenda | whether it's liberal or conservative or otherwise |"""" he said. """"It's just not the place to adopt these policies.""""Obama has opened an entirely new frontier of presidential power by turning to state and local governments | said Matthew Eshbaugh-Soha | who studies the effect of presidential persuasion at the University of North Texas.""""I'm really struck by | one | why hasn't anybody thought of this before? And two | this could be a very effective strategy |"""" Eshbaugh-Soha said. """"At a time when executive orders are becoming particularly controversial and you're not able to break through the gridlock of Congress | I think it's ingenious.""""He's skeptical that the effort will put much pressure on members of Congress who don't support Obama's policies.Jarrett said the effort is starting to snowball. She said some city leaders agreed with paid leave on principle but were reluctant to pass what could be seen as burdensome regulations in a difficult economy. As more cities and states have passed those policies | it's emboldened others.""""Success begets success |"""" she said. """"What the evidence has begun to show is it's not a burden but an investment that is starting to pay off.""""Indeed | Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter vetoed two paid leave bills in 2011 and 2013. But three weeks after Obama's State of the Union Address this year | Nutter reversed course.What changed? Nutter said the economy was better | and the bill contained key compromises to accommodate small businesses. Nutter spokesman Mark McDonald said he was unaware of any role Obama had in getting the bill passed.Bill Greenlee | the councilman who sponsored the measure | said Nutter """"completely turned a corner"""" on paid leave when the president put it on his agenda. """"I gotta think that when the president mentions sick leave in his State of the Union | and if you're a Democrat and a supporter of the president's agenda in general | that's gotta have an effect  Greenlee said.Nutter did make a symbolic nod to Obama's influence in signing the paid leave bill: He signed it with a pen Obama gave him — after the president used it to sign an unemployment compensation bill. The only other time Nutter used that pen was on an executive order raising the minimum wage for city contractors to $12 an hour.""","get around congress obama turn city hall washington president obama

7049,Celebrity Deathmatch: Darkmoon Sages Make Their Final Predictions on US Election,Is Trump the lesser of two evils or are both candidates equally unelectable? THE GREAT DEBATE BEGINS: We’ll know who is right tomorrow! SARDONICUS (to Flopot) : I know it makes your blood boil to consider the “lesser of two evils” scenario. But LD has always been a conscientious non-voter and is therefore unlikely to be voting for either Trump or Hillary. Nor am I for that matter | since I am a UK resident and do not get to vote in the American elections. You really must reconcile yourself | Flopot | to the fact that Hillary is held in such visceral loathing that her millions of haters feel they have no option but to vote for her opponent | Donald Trump | even though they are aware of the Donald’s many faults and his Zionist connections. It’s either not voting at all or voting for the lesser of two evils. FLOPOT : You don’t understand the meaning of “lesser of two evils”. It is a con trick; it doesn’t exist. Donald will pursue the same globalist wars and cultural revolutions as any other Zionist puppet. It is a meme that exists to get your consent to continue the same evil. HARBINGER: Hear hear. Exactly Flopot. As I’ve stated umpteen times | Trump is good cop | Hillary is bad. But sadly | Sardonicus does not see the ‘grand plan’ even though the likes of Zbigniew Brzezinski and Carroll Quigley do | both very much part of that process. There is not one politician in the west who becomes what they are | without a careful vetting procedure. Classic example is Jeremy Corbin  | whom many thought was going to be the saviour of Labour and take it to the Zionists | when he has proven without any shadow of a doubt that he’s a rampant Zionist | even though who goes on pro Palestine marches. Trump is a puppet. Clinton is a puppet. May is a puppet. Merkel is a puppet….. There is not ONE politician in the west who isn’t part of the ‘grand plan’ and it’s why everything works according to plan. SARDONICUS (to Flopot and Harbinger) : Yes | I understand exactly what both you and Harbinger are saying and I can sympathize with your viewpoint. You are saying there is NO LESSER OF TWO EVILS here since both candidates are EQUALLY EVIL. Because both are Zionists and will deliver a program to further Jewish interests. That’s what you’re saying | right? The only difference | as Harbie indicates | is that one of these two candidates is playing the “bad cop” (Hillary) and the other is playing the “good cop” (Trump). So it’s nonsense to vote for the “good cop” as the “lesser of two evils” when both cops are equally evil when the chips are down. This is your argument and I can sympathize with it only if you are correct in your initial assumption that Trump has no redeeming features whatever and is a total charlatan and liar who will break every single promise of his if he gets into the White House. You are entitled to that assumption | but you are NOT entitled to believe that your assumption is universally shared. Kevin MacDonald certainly doesn’t believe that Trump is a thorough scoundrel who will sell all White America down the river as soon as he is elected. Nor do the thousands of White Nationalists and other White Americans who share MacDonald’s perfectly acceptable and intellectually defensible views. These millions of Trump supporters do NOT believe that Trump is an unmitigated scoundrel who will break his promise to build a wall to keep the Mexicans out. Trump has said he has no intention of starting a war with Russia. Hillary has made no such promise. Trump has said he will crack down on illegal immigrants | especially Muslim immigrants from hostile Muslim states. Well | MacDonald and his White Nationalists are giving Trump the benefit of the doubt. I for one refuse to think that Kevin MacDonald and the millions who are hoping for a resurgence of White ethnic interests are deluded and mistaken in their advocacy of Donald Trump. They could be right. Trump could be their man and actually deliver the goods | i.e. | improve the lives of millions of White Americans who are now suffering under Jewish hegemony and a multiculturalism that has gone mad. The pessimism both of you share in regard to the irredeemable character of Donald Trump is simply a subjective state of mind. It’s an opinion | not a fact. I may choose to say | “I can’t stand garlic and onions.” This makes me a garlic-and-onion pessimist. My subjective viewpoint that garlic and onions are horrible vegetables does not make it a scientific fact that garlic and onions are horrible vegetables. The garlic and onion eaters of the world are entitled to tell me to get lost if I told everyone to give up eating garlic and onions. So it is with Flopot and Harbinger with their Trump pessimism. They are making a logical mistake in confusing impressions with facts. It is not a FACT that Trump is a scoundrel; at the most it is a subjective opinion. HP : Trump is not a politician who has been a politician who grew up a politician and lived and breathed politics all his adult life. Apart from business/social | of course. He’s an Alpha businessman who just happens to be waaay more intelligent and personally powerful than 99% of the political mediocres who envy and hate him. He came from out of nowhere and like a freight train rolled right over them before they could even cry foul or man an offense against him based on their default slime factor M.O. Hell | he vetted them ! Even as the entire weight of the political | M$M | Hollywood | Academia | foreigners | etc. | etc. | set upon him like no other in memory near or far. But they couldn’t even put a dent in him | or scare him off | and you know the vile demons tried very hard. He didn’t scare. But he did and does scare them. A lot. Being a uber-quick study | he easily overtook and surpassed the half-bright bureaucrat politicians and within one solitary year he IS The Alpha Politician. Putin (and his 12 time zones full of natural resources) will no doubt enjoy Trump. Putin will respect his intelligence | embrace his personality | utilize his uber-business talents and skills | and very very importantly | hugely importantly.. share their big big patriotism for their nations | their citizens.. In other words: The world gets an early Christmas present this year! UNGENIUS: Well said | HP! I would add only one statement: Trump is not a murderer | but Killery is a murderer of long standing which should make a choice simple between the two. GILBERT HUNTLY: Sardonicus | thanks for your healthy and sane perspective! Well said! 🙂 LOBRO: Seconding that. And add HP’s perceptive comment [ above ] to the score for level headed reason. ARIADNATHEO: Sardonicus | Harbinger and Flopot: You are all wrong | as I used to be | I admit. “Jewish hegemony |” “zionism” …. are nothing but red herrings that distract our attention from the real enemy. It’s not “Jews | Jews | Jews |” it’s Goyim | goyim | goyim. I owe it to Amy Martin to have finally understood who are | to cite her “the two more powerful lobbyists in the US” — the Podesta brothers! Also who are the real rulers whose vast web of corruption brought them virtually absolute power: the Clintons! No Jews are involved anywhere. Amy is really good (AND good looking). Why did RT get rid of her? KAREN: Ariadnatheo | great satire! FLOPOT: Satire reveals truth | though. We’re our own worst enemy — gullible goy; the malleable toy.

The former Massachusetts governor didn't have just one misstep that allowed Democrats and Republican primary opponents to paint him as an obscenely wealthy | out-of-touch plutocrat in the 2012 election -- he had a dozen. Here's just a brief sampling:""""I'm in this race because I care about Americans. I'm not concerned about the very poor. We have a safety net there. If it needs repair | I'll fix it |"""" he said inelegantly following his victory in the Florida primary. """"I'm not concerned about the very rich | they're doing just fine. I'm concerned about the very heart of the America | the 90 percent | 95 percent of Americans who right now are struggling.""""""""Corporations are people | my friend ... of course they are. Everything corporations earn ultimately goes to the people"," he said before the Iowa Ames straw poll.And his infamous remarks about """"47 percent"""" of Americans: """"My job is not to worry about those people -- I'll never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.""""But it's not just the gaffes. Romney embraced the Paul Ryan budget in 2012 -- a sweeping plan that | if enacted | would have instituted draconian cuts to programs affecting the poor. Millions of low-income Americans benefiting from Medicare | Medicaid and Social Security | as well as other retirement funding | would have been affected under a Romney presidency. Added to his promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act and its subsidies for the poor | it's not hard to see how Romney wouldn't be vexed by some of the same problems should he ultimately decide to run for president.""",REAL,,,"Mitt Romney's Re-Invention As Anti-Poverty Warrior |""With the shake of an Etch-A-Sketch | Mitt Romney reintroduced himself to the Republican Party on Friday as a man interested in running for president because of his desire to address poverty and income inequality.

The former Massachusetts governor didn't have just one misstep that allowed Democrats and Republican primary opponents to paint him as an obscenely wealthy | out-of-touch plutocrat in the 2012 election -- he had a dozen. Here's just a brief sampling:""""I'm in this race because I care about Americans. I'm not concerned about the very poor. We have a safety net there. If it needs repair | I'll fix it |"""" he said inelegantly following his victory in the Florida primary. """"I'm not concerned about the very rich | they're doing just fine. I'm concerned about the very heart of the America | the 90 percent | 95 percent of Americans who right now are struggling.""""""""Corporations are people | my friend ... of course they are. Everything corporations earn ultimately goes to the people  he said before the Iowa Ames straw poll.And his infamous remarks about """"47 percent"""" of Americans: """"My job is not to worry about those people -- I'll never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.""""But it's not just the gaffes. Romney embraced the Paul Ryan budget in 2012 -- a sweeping plan that | if enacted | would have instituted draconian cuts to programs affecting the poor. Millions of low-income Americans benefiting from Medicare | Medicaid and Social Security | as well as other retirement funding | would have been affected under a Romney presidency. Added to his promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act and its subsidies for the poor | it's not hard to see how Romney wouldn't be vexed by some of the same problems should he ultimately decide to run for president.""","mitt romney's re-invention anti-poverty warrior shake etch-a-sketch mitt romney reintroduce republican party friday man interested run president desire address poverty income inequality one wonder former governor massachusetts neglect focus grow problem last time hold title gop standard bearer.addressing gathering republican national committee official deck decommissioned u.s.s midway aircraft carrier san diego california romney tick three priority crucial call post-obama era making world safer muscular foreign policy provide opportunity american lift people poverty.""""it's tragedy human tragedy middle class country large believe future good past say see rise income decades.""""""""the rich gotten richer income inequality gotten bad people poverty ever president added.romney stress year lds pastor topic campaign rarely broach describe work people poor help get help.""""the governor potential republican presidential candidate embrace populist tone wage growth continue lag accelerate economic recovery former florida gov jeb bush recently lament last eight year pretty good one top-earners they've lose decade rest america former pennsylvania sen rick santorum emphasize reconnecting blue collar american even die-hard conservative like sen rand paul r-ky ted cruz r-texas pay lip service matter heritage foundation policy summit annual gathering conservative washington.while may sincere pursuit eliminate poverty notion romney would best candidate lead party puzzle best former massachusetts governor one misstep allow democrat republican primary opponent paint obscenely wealthy out-of-touch plutocrat election dozen here's brief sampling:""""i'm race care americans i'm concerned poor safety net need repair i'll fix say inelegantly follow victory florida primary i'm concern rich they're fine i'm concerned heart america percent percent american right struggling.""""""""corporations people friend course everything corporation earn ultimately go people say iowa ames straw poll.and infamous remark percent american job worry people i'll never convince take personal responsibility care lives.""""but gaffe romney embrace paul ryan budget sweeping plan enact would institute draconian cut program affect poor million low-income american benefit medicare medicaid social security well retirement funding would affect romney presidency add promise repeal affordable care act subsidy poor hard see romney vex problem ultimately decide run president"

1718,Ted Cruz is toast: It’s not just that he won’t be president — his days in the Senate are numbered | too,I’m not sure when it started | but at some point the Republican Party ceded the business of governance to the Democrats. Maybe it began with the Tea Party movement or Fox News or the larger conservative media-industrial complex – I honestly don’t know. But it’s clear now that the GOP is no longer a legitimate governing party. A party that allows rank neophytes like Herman Cain and Donald Trump and Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina to run for the highest office in the country has lost its way.If you look at how the Republican Party operates today | it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that governing just isn’t a priority – or internal pressures within the party make it impossible. Instead | the GOP has become what I previously called a self-perpetuating hype machine for conservative political entrepreneurs. Particularly at the national level | Republican candidates and legislators (many of them | at least) show no interest in compromise or serious policymaking | which is what you’d expect from a party of and for purists.While the new GOP has been bad for the country | it’s been great for political celebrities | people looking to promote their personal brands. Ted Cruz is the most recent and obvious example of this approach to politics. Cruz has been a remarkably ineffective Senator. He has done nothing but bloviate and showboat on the Senate floor. He’s accomplished zero legislatively. His only practical contribution has been to obstruct and draw attention to his martyrdom (read: presidential) campaign.Ted Cruz will never be elected president. If he manages to win the Republican nomination | he’ll lose in a landslide to a Democrat | whoever that happens to be. And because he’s so eagerly made a spectacle of himself in the Senate | he’s alienated all but the tiniest segment of his own party. Which means he has no political capital in Congress – hardly a concern for someone uninterested in legislating | however.Cruz’s latest squabble with Rand Paul helps to illustrate Cruz’s intentions. In an interview with Fox News’ Brian Kilmeade | Paul basically wrote Cruz’s political obituary:Ted has chosen to make this really personal and chosen to call people dishonest in leadership and call them names which really goes against the decorum and also against the rules of the senate | and as a consequence he can’t get anything done legislatively. He is pretty much done for and stifled and it’s really because of personal relationships | or lack of personal relationships | and it is a problem. I approach things a little different | I am still just as hardcore in saying what we are doing  | I just chose not to call people liars on the Senate floor and it’s just a matter of different perspectives on how best to get to the end result.Paul is right | of course | but he omits an essential point: Cruz has been ineffective by design. Managing relationships and respecting decorum only matter to people trying to accomplish things in the Senate – that’s not what Cruz is up to. Like the fanatical Tea Party wing of the House | Cruz is there to obstruct and self-promote. In all likelihood | Cruz will retire after a single term in the Senate. Now that he’s boosted his national profile and endeared himself to the insurgent elements of the base | he can pivot to the private sector and make more money as a professional conservative activist – as | for example | Jim DeMint did in 2012. Cruz ought to be seen as the grifter that he is. It was never about policy for him. When he leaves the Senate | he’ll be a hero to the fringe right. He’ll make a fortune on the conservative lecture circuit | telling rapturous audiences about his willingness to challenge the “Washington cartel.” It won’t matter that he accomplished nothing | changed nothing – it’ll be enough that he pretended to while he was there. The same is true of Carson and Trump and Fiorina and even politicians like Huckabee and Jindal: None of them will be president | but their over-the-top activism will ensure them a profitable career after politics. And that | I assume | is the whole point.

143,"Obama’s speech in Selma was an answer to those who question his love for America |""President Obama's supporters sometimes wonder where the inspirational candidate of 2008 has gone. The answer is to the White House.

930,"Where Does Bernie Sanders Go From Here? |""NEW YORK - Bernie Sanders is at a crossroads.The Vermont senator took Wednesday off the campaign trail at home alone with his wife | leaving his top aides behind in Washington to cool their heels.""""He wanted an opportunity to think |"""" said Sanders senior strategist Tad Devine. """"It's affording him an opportunity to think about where we are in the campaign | what he wants to say in the weeks ahead. He hasn't had a real chance to do that"""" in weeks.The Sanders campaign poured itself into New York | throwing a hail mary pass to try to change the delegate math while they could. They spent $5.6 million (twice what Hillary Clinton did) | made 3 million phone calls in the final weekend alone | and organized the biggest rallies of a campaign defined by big rallies.But in the end Sanders came up short - not just of winning | but of the delegate target allies had aimed to hit | which might set them up for a path through California | the campaign's final hope.Now | with the nomination even further out of reach | Sanders faces the difficult question about what comes next. Does he set a do-whatever-it-takes course to actually win the Democratic nomination? Or does he return to the message campaign his long-shot White House bid was originally seen as?There's no question that Sanders will stay in the race either way. """"Bernie made a decision after Nevada that he was going to go through this process and finish it up by letting everybody who wanted to vote | vote |"""" Devine said.Democratic primary voters have shown no sign they're in a rush for the race to settle down | and seem hungry for Sanders' message | if not his presidency.He'll continue to draw massive crowds from zealous fans | who have almost literally given his campaign a blank check to do as they wish. On Wednesday night | the campaign announced raising $15 million more than Clinton in March | though they also spent much more.But even some Sanders allies cringed at parts of the candidate's message in New York | where his agenda was sometimes obscured by a focus on Clinton and issues with the election process.""""Going forward | what we're encouraging Senator Sanders to do is to continue to keep the campaign focused on the issues |"""" said Neil Sroka | the communications director of Democracy for America | which backs Sanders.The campaign says they want to return to more substantive issues - but only as long as the Clinton campaign joins them. So far | at least | they believe Clinton forces are keeping up the heat and see it as sign Clinton still views Sanders as a threat.Privately | some Sanders allies say it's time for the candidate to start to thinking more about how he maximizes his leverage at the Democratic National Convention | and afterwards | and less about beating Clinton at all costs.One indicator of which kind of campaign Sanders wants to run is how much he and his aides continue to talk about relying on super delegates to hand them the nomination.The strategy | which calls for wooing the unelected delegates even if Sanders loses more primaries and caucuses | was floated by campaign manager Jeff Weaver with MSNBC's Steve Kornacki late Tuesday night.MoveOn.org and Democracy for America | both of which have endorsed Sanders | have since 2008 been pressuring super delegates to support whichever candidate gets the most votes.More than 380 |000 people signed petitions from the group agreeing that """"the race for the Democratic Party nomination should be decided by who gets the most votes | and not who has the most support from party insiders.""""Both groups confirmed to MSNBC Wednesday that they still hold that position.""""MoveOn members overwhelmingly endorsed Sanders for president | and we want him to win the most pledged delegates | become the nominee | and become president.

""""It's affording him an opportunity to think about where we are in the campaign | what he wants to say in the weeks ahead. He hasn't had a real chance to do that"""" in weeks.The Sanders campaign poured itself into New York | throwing a hail mary pass to try to change the delegate math while they could. They spent $5.6 million (twice what Hillary Clinton did) | made 3 million phone calls in the final weekend alone | and organized the biggest rallies of a campaign defined by big rallies.But in the end Sanders came up short - not just of winning | but of the delegate target allies had aimed to hit | which might set them up for a path through California | the campaign's final hope.Now | with the nomination even further out of reach | Sanders faces the difficult question about what comes next. Does he set a do-whatever-it-takes course to actually win the Democratic nomination? Or does he return to the message campaign his long-shot White House bid was originally seen as?There's no question that Sanders will stay in the race either way. """"Bernie made a decision after Nevada that he was going to go through this process and finish it up by letting everybody who wanted to vote | vote |"""" Devine said.Democratic primary voters have shown no sign they're in a rush for the race to settle down | and seem hungry for Sanders' message | if not his presidency.He'll continue to draw massive crowds from zealous fans | who have almost literally given his campaign a blank check to do as they wish. On Wednesday night | the campaign announced raising $15 million more than Clinton in March | though they also spent much more.But even some Sanders allies cringed at parts of the candidate's message in New York | where his agenda was sometimes obscured by a focus on Clinton and issues with the election process.""""Going forward | what we're encouraging Senator Sanders to do is to continue to keep the campaign focused on the issues |"""" said Neil Sroka | the communications director of Democracy for America | which backs Sanders.The campaign says they want to return to more substantive issues - but only as long as the Clinton campaign joins them. So far | at least | they believe Clinton forces are keeping up the heat and see it as sign Clinton still views Sanders as a threat.Privately | some Sanders allies say it's time for the candidate to start to thinking more about how he maximizes his leverage at the Democratic National Convention | and afterwards | and less about beating Clinton at all costs.One indicator of which kind of campaign Sanders wants to run is how much he and his aides continue to talk about relying on super delegates to hand them the nomination.The strategy | which calls for wooing the unelected delegates even if Sanders loses more primaries and caucuses | was floated by campaign manager Jeff Weaver with MSNBC's Steve Kornacki late Tuesday night.MoveOn.org and Democracy for America | both of which have endorsed Sanders | have since 2008 been pressuring super delegates to support whichever candidate gets the most votes.More than 380 |000 people signed petitions from the group agreeing that """"the race for the Democratic Party nomination should be decided by who gets the most votes | and not who has the most support from party insiders.""""Both groups confirmed to MSNBC Wednesday that they still hold that position.""""MoveOn members overwhelmingly endorsed Sanders for president | and we want him to win the most pledged delegates | become the nominee | and become president.

[insert] This may well be the reason President Obama yesterday had his press secretary praise the work of Jim Comey | head of the FBI | at the very moment that Hillary Clinton was speaking in Florida deriding Comey. Let us all pray that Comey has actually turned away from being subservient to Obama and the Clintons and has now joined forces with the vast majority of the American military/intelligence community and Obama has decided – for his own preservation – to not fight them.

3255,Give Social Security recipients a CEO-style raise,(CNN) On Veterans Day we recognize and honor the sacrifices our service members and their families make for our country. We owe our service members the very best | but unless Congress acts | on January 1 more than 9 million veterans who rely on Social Security benefits or pension and compensation benefits will not get their annual cost of living increase.This freeze in funds | which has happened only two other times since 1975 | will be really tough on veterans among the 71 million Americans who depend on Social Security and other benefits to help make ends meet. Two-thirds of seniors depend on Social Security for the majority of their income | and for 15 million Americans | Social Security is all that stands between them and poverty.While vets and seniors get no raise | CEOs at the top 350 American companies received | on average | a 3.9% pay increase last year. That's a lot of money. The average CEO at one of the top 350 American companies made $16.3 million and got more than half a million in pay raises. So CEOs get huge raises | while seniors | veterans and others who've worked hard don't get an extra dime. Why? It's not an accident. It's not inevitable. It's the result of deliberate policies set by Congress.Social Security is supposed to be indexed to inflation so that when prices go up | benefits go up | too. But Congress' formula samples the spending patterns of about a quarter of the country | and the formula isn't geared to what older Americans actually spend.Projections for the costs of core goods and services show inflation is up about 2% | but seniors won't get a cost of living increase -- mostly because of falling gasoline prices | which don't mean as much to millions of seniors who don't commute to work. So seniors | who are already struggling to scrape by to cover rent and exploding prescription drug prices  | will be left scrambling.Sure | companies should make their own decisions about how much to compensate executives | but because of the laws Congress has passed | American taxpayers are forced to subsidize these multimillion-dollar pay packages.It's time for Congress to make different choices. That's why last week I introduced the Seniors And Veterans Emergency (SAVE) Benefits Act. The SAVE Benefits Act will give seniors on Social Security | veterans | those with disabilities and others a one-time payment in 2016 equivalent to an average increase of 3.9% -- the same as the taxpayer-subsidized raise that CEOs received last year.We can afford to give seniors and vets a raise. In fact | we can increase pay for seniors and vets without adding a single penny to the deficit simply by closing the bonus loophole for corporate executives. According to the chief actuary of the Social Security Administration | closing this loophole will create enough revenue to help millions of Americans and still have enough left over to help extend the life of the Social Security trust fund.Seniors and vets would get an increase of about $581 next year — a little less than $50 a month. That $581 increase would cover almost three months of groceries for seniors or a year's worth of out-of-pocket costs on critical prescription drugs for the average Medicare beneficiary. That $50 a month is worth a lot to those 71 million Americans. According to an analysis from the Economic Policy Institute | that little boost could lift more than 1 million Americans out of poverty.Giving vets and seniors a little help and stitching up these corporate tax write-offs isn't just about economics; it's about our values. For too long | we've listened to a handful of people with money and power who say: Cut taxes for those at the top | cut rules and regulations that keep everyone honest | and let everyone else fight over the scraps. We tried trickle-down economics | and it failed.But we can make different choices -- choices that reflect our values. We don't have to ignore this problem. We can give a small boost to 71 million Americans who have earned it and who need it.We can lift over 1 million people out of poverty. We can extend the life of Social Security. And we can do it by shutting down taxpayer giveaways to a handful of wealthy corporations that will do fine without them. For me | this is simple.

3177,Fireworks erupt between Trump and Bush | Rubio and Cruz at GOP debate,Sparks flew at the toughest and liveliest GOP primary debate yet Saturday night | as Donald Trump and Jeb Bush clashed over the Middle East and George W. Bush’s legacy | trading insults at a rapid clip – and the two Cuban-American senators in the race accused each other of lying on immigration and even questioned each other’s Spanish-speaking skills.And just when it seemed Trump and Ted Cruz might steer clear of each other | the two leading Republican candidates entered the ring toward the end of the debate when the Texas senator questioned the billionaire businessman’s pro-life credentials.“You are the single biggest liar. You’re probably worse than Jeb Bush |” Trump said.Cruz stood his ground | charging that Trump would “appoint liberals” to the Supreme Court if elected.The issue of judicial appointments was front and center at the CBS News-hosted debate in Greenville | S.C. | in the wake of Justice Antonin Scalia’s death | with candidates like Cruz saying it underscores the high stakes in this election. Several candidates called for a delay in any high court appointment or confirmation.But the barbed and often personal exchanges Saturday marked a new phase of the race | as the candidates charge into next week’s critical South Carolina primary. The clashes left Ohio Gov. John Kasich – the affable | second-place finisher in the New Hampshire primary – making an appeal for peace in the GOP field | albeit one unlikely to be heeded.“I think we’re fixing to lose the election to Hillary Clinton if we don’t stop this |” Kasich said.Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson | too | warned about the coming general election and said | “We cannot be tearing each other down.”The appeals came shortly after Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio accused each other of being soft on illegal immigration. It’s an argument they’ve had before – Cruz faults Rubio for backing a comprehensive immigration reform bill that included a path to legal status | and Rubio says Cruz was on board with that effort – but this time | it became more heated. And after Cruz accused Rubio of saying on Univision he wouldn’t rescind President Obama’s immigration executive orders on day one | Rubio quipped:“I don’t know how he knows what I said on Univision because he doesn’t speak Spanish |” Rubio said.Cruz | then | immediately began debating Rubio in Spanish. Rubio continued | saying Cruz “lies about all sorts of things” and indeed supports legalizing illegal immigrants.As the Rubio-Cruz battle heated up | so did the long-simmering feud between Trump and Bush.“This is a man who insults his way to the nomination |” Bush said of Trump.With Bush attempting a comeback in the race after a fourth-place finish in New Hampshire | Trump faced a feistier debate rival on stage Saturday night than he has before – boosted in part by what seemed to be a sympathetic audience.The audience often booed Trump when he took on Bush | though Trump once again accused them of representing Bush’s “special interests and lobbyists.”Their most personal dispute came when Trump accused Bush of promoting a policy that would get the U.S. mired more deeply in the Middle East – and blamed the former Florida governor’s brother for the problems there.Trump initially took issue with Jeb Bush’s call to confront ISIS while also taking on Syria’s Bashar Assad and sidelining Russia.“Jeb is so wrong |” Trump said. “You have to knock out ISIS. .... You decide what you have to do after. You can’t fight two wars at one time.”Bush | though | said Russia is not a U.S. ally | and Assad’s hold on power prevents a resolution in the war. Trump then went on to repeatedly slam the decision under the George W. Bush administration to enter Iraq in the first place | calling it a “big fat mistake” that “destabilized the Middle East.”“They lied” about WMDs | he said.“I am sick and tired of him going after my family |” Jeb Bush countered | saying he’s proud of his brother’s efforts to keep the country safe.Trump then invoked 9/11: “The World Trade Center came down … That’s not keeping us safe.”Rubio | who has often been at odds with Bush | leapt to his brother’s defense | saying the Bush administration “kept us safe.”Jeb Bush joked that he was rescinding Trump’s invitation to an upcoming rally with George W. Bush on the campaign trail.The fireworks flew after the debate started on a somber note | discussing the legacy of Supreme Court Justice Scalia and the impact his death Saturday will have.Several candidates urged President Obama to refrain from nominating anybody to fill the vacancy | and wait for the next president to make that decision. Trump | though | said he doesn’t expect Obama to wait | and called on Senate Republicans to hold up any nomination.Kasich urged Obama to put the “country first” and not move forward with a nomination | a plea echoed by Rubio. Obama | though | said minutes before the start of the debate that he indeed plans to nominate a successor.The GOP candidates | meanwhile | used opening remarks to honor Scalia’s legacy.Cruz called him a “legal giant” who “changed the arc of American legal history.” He said Scalia’s death also “underscores the stakes of this election.”“We are one justice away from a Supreme Court that will strike down every restriction on abortion” by states | threaten gun rights and “undermine” religious liberty | Cruz said. He said he would appoint a strict constitutionalist if elected.Scalia’s death thrusts the issue of judicial appointments into the 2016 race | raising the possibility that the next president immediately will have to fill a high court vacancy.

Trump at one point accused Cruz of trying to spread rumors in the state that he’s not running in South Carolina – likening that to his campaign’s actions in Iowa | where representatives spread false rumors that Carson was dropping out.“Nasty guy | now I know why he doesn’t have one endorsement from any of his colleagues |” Trump said.Even Kasich struggled to avoid the fray | as Bush criticized him for expanding Medicaid under ObamaCare and said that would create more debt.“He knows that I’m not for ObamaCare |” Kasich said | before vowing to stay “positive. “The GOP field is now down to six candidates -- after New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Hewlett Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina dropped out following low finishes Tuesday in the New Hampshire primary.A big question Saturday night | and going forward | was whether Rubio could regain his momentum – following last weekend’s lackluster performance.
